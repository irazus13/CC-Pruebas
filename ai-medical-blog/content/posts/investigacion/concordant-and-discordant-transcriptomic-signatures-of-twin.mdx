## Resumen

**BACKGROUND:** Multifetal pregnancies have increased preeclampsia risk, but the underlying pathogenesis may differ from that of singletons. It remains unclear whether twin placentas show molecular signs of preeclampsia synchronously. **METHODS:** We performed RNA sequencing on 32 individual placental samples from twin gestations grouped by preeclampsia status: 24 dichorionic twin (DT) and 8 monochorionic twin gestations. Ten singleton placentas from preeclamptic pregnancies were also analyzed. A benchmark data set (GSE203507, GSE114691, and GSE1482410) and a test data set (GSE190973) comprised 71 early onset preeclampsia and 69 control singleton placentas. Differential abundance analysis was conducted, and machine learning was used to derive a novel 98-transcript classification signature (accuracy &gt;0.97 in benchmark and test data sets). **RESULTS:** Across 7 groups, 2946 transcripts were differentially modulated (likelihood-ratio test; false discovery rate &lt;0.05). Placental signature scoring distinguished normotensive from early onset preeclampsia in GSE203507 singletons (P&lt;0.0001) although normotensive DTs did not differ from DTs with preeclampsia (Kruskal-Wallis/Dunn). Notably, some twin placentas without clinical preeclampsia exhibited preeclampsia-like profiles. Linear mixed-effects regression, which accounted for intertwin correlation structure, revealed increasing signature scores across singleton and DT groups (all P&lt;0.01): normotensive singletons&lt;normotensive DT&lt;DT with preeclampsia&lt;singletons with preeclampsia. Functional analysis in twins showed preeclampsia-like dysregulation but with pronounced variability. Intertwin divergence was more prominent in DT than in monochorionic twin samples, regardless of clinical diagnosis. **CONCLUSIONS:** These findings highlight the complexity of preeclampsia pathology in twins. In DT pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia, placental involvement may be asymmetrical, suggesting that disease may arise from a single affected placenta; however, these results require replication.
