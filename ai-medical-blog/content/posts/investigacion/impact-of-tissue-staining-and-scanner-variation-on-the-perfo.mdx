## Resumen

Histopathological analysis is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis and prognostication of cancer. Recent advances in AI, driven by large&#x2010;scale digitisation and pan&#x2010;cancer foundation models, are opening new opportunities for clinical integration. However, it remains unclear how robust these foundation models are to real&#x2010;world sources of variability, particularly in H&amp;E staining and scanners produced by different manufacturers. In this study, we use soft tissue tumours, a rare and morphologically diverse tumour type, as a challenging test case to systematically investigate the colour&#x2010;related robustness and generalisability of seven AI models. Controlled staining and scanning experiments were utilised to assess model performance across diverse real&#x2010;world data sources. Foundation models, particularly UNI&#x2010;v2, Virchow and TITAN, demonstrated encouraging robustness to staining and scanning variation, particularly when a small number of stain&#x2010;varied slides were included in the training loop, highlighting their potential as adaptable and data&#x2010;efficient tools for real&#x2010;world digital pathology workflows.
