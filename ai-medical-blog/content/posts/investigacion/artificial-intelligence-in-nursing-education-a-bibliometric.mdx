## Resumen

**BACKGROUND:** The swift advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly impacted multiple industries. The prospects of AI within nursing education are especially promising, as it presents avenues for enhancing the preparation of forthcoming nursing practitioners in a constantly changing healthcare landscape. **METHODS:** We employed VOSviewer, CiteSpace, and the Bibliometrix R package to effectively visualize the bibliometric findings. **RESULTS:** A total of 430 publications were identified. The predominant sources of these publications were the United States of America and China, while the National University of Singapore emerged as the foremost contributor. The journals that provided the most substantial input in this area included Nurse Education Today and Nurse Education in Practice. Furthermore, keywords showed significant citation bursts and trending topics, such as technology, educational programs, and simulation. **CONCLUSIONS:** The results of this investigation offer novel perspectives for scholars who are keen on examining the integration of AI in the training of nursing education.
