## Resumen

**BACKGROUND:** Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) or ROS proto-oncogene 1 (ROS1) rearranged non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) develop bypass resistance mechanisms that activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway signaling. We conducted a study to evaluate the ALK/ROS1 inhibitor lorlatinib combined with MAPK pathway inhibitors: binimetinib (MEK inhibitor) or TNO155 (SHP2 inhibitor). **PATIENTS AND METHODS:** This phase IB study employed a 3&#xa0;+&#xa0;3 design. Patients who had disease progression on ALK or ROS1 inhibitors received lorlatinib (50&#xa0;mg or 75&#xa0;mg daily) with binimetinib (30&#xa0;mg or 45&#xa0;mg BID) or TNO155 (40&#xa0;mg or 50&#xa0;mg daily). The primary objective of phase 1 was determining the recommended phase 2 dose for the combinations. The primary objective of the phase 2 portion was determining the objective response rate (ORR) of each combination. Secondary endpoints included safety and tolerability and progression-free survival. **RESULTS:** In this phase IB clinical trial, 17 patients received lorlatinib and binimetinib; two patients received lorlatinib with TNO155. All patients with ALK&#xa0;+&#xa0;NSCLC had received prior lorlatinib. Among 15 evaluable patients in the lorlatinib-binimetinib cohort, one (6.7%) had a partial response (duration of response: 114&#xa0;days), eight (53.3%) had stable disease, and six (40%) experienced primary progression. Median progression-free survival on lorlatinib-binimetinib was 51&#xa0;days (95% CI 39-107). Treatment-related adverse events associated with lorlatinib-binimetinib were primarily grade 1-2, including rash (65%), edema (47%), and lipid abnormalities (47%). One patient discontinued treatment for grade 2 retinopathy. In the lorlatinib-TNO155 arm, both patients stopped treatment due to rapid disease progression and pleural effusions, limiting efficacy evaluation. The study was terminated due to slow accrual before advancing to the phase 2 component. **CONCLUSIONS:** Regimens co-targeting the MAPK pathway and ALK or ROS1 had limited efficacy in unselected patients with lorlatinib-resistant NSCLC, underscoring the need for more effective and biomarker-informed treatment strategies.
