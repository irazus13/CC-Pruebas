## Resumen

In children with severe, refractory hemispheric epilepsy syndromes, the removal or disconnection of the diseased cortex on one hemisphere from the rest of the brain (hemispherectomy) is a last-resort treatment to cure epilepsy. The removal or disconnection of the motor cortex expectedly leads to contralateral hemiparesis. Partial recovery of the leg or proximal arm may occur over time from the plasticity of alternate motor pathways, but finer hand movements generally do not recover. The advent of neuroprostheses delivering invasive or non-invasive stimulation at different levels of the motor pathways holds promise to enhance motor recovery after a neurologic injury. In this manuscript, we review the mechanisms of motor recovery after a hemispherectomy and discuss how emerging neuromodulation options could be used to improve function. We conclude that the most suitable neuromodulation options for short-term clinical trials are vagal nerve stimulation paired with rehabilitation, and tonic spinal cord stimulation (transcutaneous or with implanted electrodes). We also identify promising neuromodulation options that would require further preclinical investigation in animal models: subcortical deep brain stimulation (motor thalamus, contralateral dentate nucleus), brain-spine interfacing, and motor cortex stimulation. Altogether, this manuscript lays the theoretical foundations for the investigation of neuromodulation therapies to improve the motor outcomes of patients who underwent a hemispherectomy for refractory epilepsy.
