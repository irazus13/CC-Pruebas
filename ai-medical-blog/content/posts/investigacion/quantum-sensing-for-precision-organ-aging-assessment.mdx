## Resumen

Aging proceeds heterogeneously across organs, making chronological age an inadequate measure of physiological decline. The concept of organ biological age (OBA) offers a refined framework to quantify organ-specific functional deterioration. However, current OBA assessments - based on epigenetic, transcriptomic, metabolomic, or imaging data-largely capture the outcomes rather than the onset of aging. Their limited sensitivity to nanoscale and microenvironmental alterations, low temporal resolution, and reliance on invasive sampling constrain clinical translation. This review examines the molecular and systemic mechanisms driving organ-specific aging and evaluates existing multi-omics and imaging approaches. We highlight quantum sensing technologies as a transformative solution. Leveraging quantum coherence and spin-based detection, quantum sensors enable non-invasive, real-time detection of weak magnetic, electric, and vibrational signals, providing unprecedented access to early and subtle changes within organ microenvironments. Integrated with artificial intelligence (AI), these sensors could support continuous, high-frequency tracking of organ aging trajectories and dynamically quantify the pace of aging. By bridging molecular energetics with organ physiology, quantum-enabled OBA assessment represents a new paradigm for precision aging medicine, shifting aging research from static observation to proactive and individualized health management. This process stands as the foremost risk factor for major human pathologies, including neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer, imposing unprecedented challenges on global healthcare systems.
