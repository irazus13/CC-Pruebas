## Resumen

**AIMS:** Chewing gum could play a role in managing hyperglycemia in individuals with diabetes. The study evaluated the effects of chewing gum on blood sugar management in women diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM). **METHODS:** This open-label, single-center randomized controlled clinical trial enrolled 100 women recently diagnosed with GDM. Participants received either standard care or an additional chewing gum intervention. Self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) levels were recorded over a period of five days. **RESULTS:** The gum-chewing group consistently exhibited notably lower mean postprandial blood glucose (PPG) and fasting blood glucose levels compared to the control group. The estimated mean differences (intervention vs. control group) were: -7.86&#xa0;mg/dl, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.053 (fasting blood glucose); -13.2&#xa0;mg/dl, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.022 (breakfast); -8.92&#xa0;mg/dl, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.014 (lunch); -12.96&#xa0;mg/dl, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.006 (dinner). **CONCLUSIONS:** To summarize, notable variations in blood glucose levels were identified between the groups, indicating that chewing gum serves as an effective alternative approach to reducing high blood sugar in women with GDM.
