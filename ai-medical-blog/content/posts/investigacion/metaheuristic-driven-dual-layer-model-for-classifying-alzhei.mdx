## Resumen

**INTRODUCTION:** Accurate determination of the progression phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial for timely clinical decision-making, improved patient management, and personalized therapeutic interventions. However, reliably distinguishing between multiple disease stages using neuroimaging data remains a challenging task. **METHODS:** This study proposes an advanced machine learning framework for multi-stage AD classification using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. The architecture follows a two-tier design. In the first stage, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are employed to extract deep and discriminative feature representations from MRI images. In the second stage, these features are classified using ensemble learning models, specifically XGBoost and LightGBM. Metaheuristic optimization strategies are applied to further enhance model performance. The proposed framework was evaluated using a publicly available Alzheimer's disease dataset under three different experimental configurations. **RESULTS:** Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively addresses the multi-class classification problem across different AD progression stages. The optimized models achieved a maximum classification accuracy of 89.55%, indicating robust predictive performance and strong generalization capability. **DISCUSSION:** To improve transparency and clinical relevance, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques were incorporated to interpret model predictions and highlight feature importance. The results provide meaningful insights into neuroimaging biomarkers associated with AD progression and support the development of more interpretable and trustworthy diagnostic systems. Overall, the proposed framework contributes to improved data-driven decision support and offers a promising direction for future Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and staging research.
