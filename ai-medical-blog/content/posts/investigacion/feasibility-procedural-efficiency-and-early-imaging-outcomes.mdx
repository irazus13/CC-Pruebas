## Resumen

**BACKGROUND AND AIMS:** Concomitant pulsed field ablation (PFA) for atrial fibrillation (AF) with left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) offers a single-procedure approach for arrhythmia control and thromboembolic risk reduction. This study assessed the workflow, safety, and feasibility of combined PFA and LAAC in routine practice. **METHODS:** We prospectively analyzed patients undergoing zero-fluoroscopy PFA, with low fluoroscopy for LAAC. Pre-procedural planning used CT imaging and AI-based models for device selection and landing zone assessment. A single transseptal puncture facilitated intracardiac echocardiography, PFA catheter, and LAAC sheath. **RESULTS:** A total of 209 patients were included (56% male; mean age 76.5 &#xb1; 7.8 years), with 59.3% paroxysmal AF, 40.7% persistent AF, and 50% de novo AF. Mean CHA2DS2-VASc score was 4.5. Mean procedure and left atrial dwell times were 57.3 &#xb1; 17 and 45.1 &#xb1; 13.6 minutes, respectively; fluoroscopy averaged 3.4 &#xb1; 0.8 minutes for LAAC. A single LAAC device was used in 94% of cases, achieving adequate seal in all. No pericardial effusion, phrenic nerve injury, kidney, or esophageal injury occurred; two patients had minor groin bleeding. All were discharged same day on oral anticoagulation for 90 days. Follow-up CT (80%) or TEE (20%) at 111.6 &#xb1; 16.5 days showed no leaks &gt;2 mm, a 4.7% small-leak rate, and two device-related thrombi without stroke, managed with extended anticoagulation. **CONCLUSIONS:** Combined PFA and LAAC is feasible and safe with favorable early outcomes. Multi-center studies are warranted to confirm findings and standardize this workflow for broader clinical adoption.
