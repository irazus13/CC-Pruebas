## Resumen

This study explores the use of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) combined with machine learning to detect physiological alterations in cassava leaves caused by Xanthomonas phaseoli pv. manihotis (Xpm), a bacterial plant disease that causes significant yield losses worldwide. Therefore, the use of hyperspectral images associated with machine learning can provide information rapidly and accurately, aiming to support decision-making. HSI captures spectral data that reflects biochemical changes in infected plant tissues. An image set of cassava healthy and symptomatic leaves (402 and 450, respectively) were imaged using a hyperspectral camera across wavelengths from 400 to 1000 nm, with image calibration and spectral normalization to improve data quality. Spectral parameters, such as mean reflectance and spectral differences (healthy vs. infected), were analyzed. Six machine learning models were tested for classification: Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). SVM performed best, achieving the highest accuracy (91.41%), followed by MLP (87.89%), XGBoost (79.69%), and RF (77.34%). DT and KNN had the lowest accuracy (71.88% and 70.31%, respectively). The results suggest that HSI, particularly when combined with SVM, offers a rapid and accurate method for diagnosing cassava bacterial blight, with potential for large-scale field applications.
