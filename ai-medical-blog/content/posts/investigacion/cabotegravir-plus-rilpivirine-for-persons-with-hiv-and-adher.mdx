## Resumen

**BACKGROUND:** Randomized trials of long-acting injectable antiretroviral therapy (ART) in persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who face challenges with adherence to oral medication are lacking. **METHODS:** We conducted an open-label, randomized trial involving persons with HIV who had inadequate adherence to ART (a persistent HIV-1 RNA level of &gt;200 copies per milliliter or loss to follow-up). Participants received up to 24 weeks of adherence support, conditional economic incentives, and standard care with oral ART (step 1). Participants who had an HIV-1 RNA level of 200 copies per milliliter or lower in step 1 were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either continue standard care or switch to monthly injections of long-acting cabotegravir plus rilpivirine with or without oral lead-in therapy (step 2). The primary outcome was regimen failure, defined as confirmed virologic failure (two consecutive HIV-1 RNA measurements of &gt;200 copies per milliliter) or treatment discontinuation during step 2. **RESULTS:** In step 1 of the trial, we enrolled 453 participants; the median age was 40 years, 63% were Black, and 29% had been assigned female sex at birth. In step 2, a total of 306 participants underwent randomization; 152 were assigned to receive cabotegravir-rilpivirine and 154 to receive standard care. Step 2 randomization was stopped early on the basis of the superiority of cabotegravir-rilpivirine to standard care in secondary outcomes at a prespecified analysis performed after a median follow-up of 48 weeks. The cumulative incidence of regimen failure by week 48 was 22.8% in the cabotegravir-rilpivirine group and 41.2% in the standard-care group (difference, -18.4 percentage points; 98.4% confidence interval [CI], -32.4 to -4.3; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002). The cumulative incidence of an adverse event was 43.5% in the cabotegravir-rilpivirine group and 42.4% in the standard-care group (difference, 1.1 percentage points; 95% CI, -12.7 to 15.0). Resistance-associated mutations developed in 2 participants with confirmed virologic failure in each group. **CONCLUSIONS:** Monthly injections of long-acting cabotegravir-rilpivirine were superior to standard oral ART in reducing the risk of regimen failure among persons with HIV who had adherence challenges.
