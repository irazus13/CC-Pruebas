## Resumen

**BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS:** The gut-liver axis is believed to be crucial in the pathogenesis of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). However, the impact of colectomy on liver disease progression is unclear. Our study estimated the effect of colectomy on PSC progression with correction for time dependency and established risk factors by pooling data from several cohorts across different countries. **METHODS:** We analysed data from the International PSC Registry (IPSCR), comprising patients from Finland, The Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden. Primary endpoint was defined as liver transplantation (LT) or PSC-related death. Cox proportional hazards regression onto time-dependent colectomy status, with specification for extent, was performed with adjustment for sex, age at diagnosis, large or small duct PSC, features of autoimmune hepatitis, time-dependent inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) status, centre of inclusion, and country of residence. **RESULTS:** A total of 3,110 participants were included, of whom 470 (15%) had undergone colectomy. During a total follow-up of 32,236 patient-years, 395 deaths and 653 LTs were observed. Compared with patients with PSC with intact colon, the hazard ratio (HR) of reaching LT or PSC-related death was significantly decreased in patients with proctocolectomy with permanent ileostomy (HR 0.41; 95% CI 0.24-0.71). This effect was less pronounced in case of hemi- or subtotal colectomy (HR 0.81; 95% CI: 0.58-1.12) and not observed for proctocolectomy with pouch (HR 1.00; 95% CI: 0.73-1.38). The reduced risk was mainly associated with a lower rate of LT or death resulting from liver failure (HR 0.24; 0.10-0.53). **CONCLUSIONS:** Proctocolectomy with permanent ileostomy was associated with decreased risk for LT and PSC-related death. These findings support the role of the gut-liver axis in the pathophysiology of PSC and call for consideration in counselling patients who face impending colorectal surgery. **IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS:** The impact of the gut-liver axis in the pathophysiology of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) has remained uncertain. In this study, proctocolectomy with ileostomy was associated with improved transplant-free survival, defined as a reduced risk of liver transplantation or PSC-related death, indicating that intestinal factors may influence disease progression. These findings are important for clinicians, researchers, and patients as they suggest that surgical management of colonic disease may have prognostic implications in PSC, and for further studies to clarify mechanisms and guide clinical decision-making.
