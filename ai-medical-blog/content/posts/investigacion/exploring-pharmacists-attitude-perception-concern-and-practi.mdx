## Resumen

**BACKGROUND:** The study aimed to assess pharmacy professionals' attitudes, perceptions, practices, and concerns about using ChatGPT in routine clinical duties in Pakistan. **METHODS:** A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted from 1 September 2024 to 1 April 2025. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed among pharmacy professionals employed in hospitals, communities, academic institutes, industries and other healthcare settings. A convenience sampling technique was utilized to recruit 405 participants. Data was analyzed using IBM SPSS statistics version 30, employing descriptive and inferential statistics, including Spearman's rank correlation, chi-square test, and binary logistic regression analysis. **RESULTS:** Among 405 participants, the majority were male (210, 51.9%), 230 (56.8%) participants were aged between 23 and 33&#x2009;years, 196 (48.4%) participants identified as single. Regarding pharmacy positions, 115 participants (28.4%) were hospital pharmacists, and the majority, 145 participants (35.8%), possessed professional experience ranging from 1 to 5&#x2009;years. Furthermore, 271 participants (67.0%) reported familiarity with AI technology in pharmacy practice. Majority of participants (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;228, 56.3%) demonstrated a positive attitude, while (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;222, 54.8%) exhibited a positive perception, and (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;232, 57.3%) reported good practice toward ChatGPT integration. Additionally, 56.0% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;227) of participants exhibited higher concerns regarding the integration of ChatGPT. **CONCLUSION:** The study findings indicate that more than half of the pharmacists demonstrated positive attitudes, perceptions, and good practices regarding using ChatGPT in pharmacy practice. Key concerns about its use include ethical considerations, privacy issues, data accuracy, and potential for bias. This highlights the necessity for extensive instructional programs to encourage educated and responsible use of ChatGPT in pharmacy practice. Future research should investigate developing and implementing customized training programs and protocols to guarantee ChatGPT's secure and efficient incorporation into pharmacy processes for enhanced patient care.
