## Resumen

**BACKGROUND:** Current reference standards for measuring gastric emptying and motility are not considered optimal due to the time required, ionizing radiation, invasiveness, and spatial resolution. **PURPOSE:** To assess gastric motility using novel real-time dynamic magnetic resonance imaging in combination with static measurements for gastric emptying and training of an automated deep-learning-based segmentation pipeline. **STUDY TYPE:** Prospective. **PARTICIPANTS:** The study included 36 healthy volunteers (20 female, mean 24&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;3&#x2009;years) and three patients with diagnosed Crohn's disease. **FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCES:** Participants ingested water to assess fasting motility and pineapple juice for the postprandial state. 3&#x2009;T, 3D spoiled gradient echo (GRE) sequence and real-time spoiled GRE. **ASSESSMENT:** Gastric emptying was measured by using the gastric volume, while motility was analyzed by tracking changes in the antrum's cross-sectional area and applying Fast Fourier Transformation. Segmentations were performed using a trained semantic segmentation model. **STATISTICAL TESTS:** Linear Mixed Model with continuous dependent variables and fixed effects. Models included a random intercept for participants. Statistical significance was defined as p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.05. **RESULTS:** The method enabled volumetric analysis of gastric content from 3D breath-hold static acquisition and time-resolved quantification of peristaltic parameters from real-time FLASH2 imaging at high temporal resolution (here 6.24&#x2009;fps). Water emptied rapidly and exponentially (t1/2&#x2009;=&#x2009;14.77&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;10.55&#x2009;min), while juice showed slower emptying (t1/2&#x2009;=&#x2009;64.24&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;11.87&#x2009;min). Contraction frequencies (fasted: 2.76&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.43&#x2009;cpm, fed: 2.89&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.43&#x2009;cpm) and velocities (fasted: 1.67&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.38&#x2009;mm/s, fed: 1.72&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.37&#x2009;mm/s) were within physiological ranges, with fasting conditions characterized by stronger occlusion compared to the fed. Measurements taken from three patients proved that the workflow could be used in a clinical context. **DATA CONCLUSION:** Real-time MRI with AI-based analysis enabled quantitative assessment of gastric emptying and motility, revealing physiological peristaltic parameters and state-dependent differences in occlusion. **EVIDENCE LEVEL:** 2. **TECHNICAL EFFICACY:** Stage 1.
