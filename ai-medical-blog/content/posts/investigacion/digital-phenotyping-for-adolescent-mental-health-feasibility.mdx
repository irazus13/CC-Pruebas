## Resumen

**BACKGROUND:** Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to mental disorders, with over 75% of lifetime cases emerging before the age of 25 years. Yet most young people with significant symptoms do not seek support. Digital phenotyping, leveraging active (self-reported) and passive (sensor-based) data from smartphones, offers a scalable, low-burden approach for early risk detection. Despite this potential, its application in school-going adolescents from general (nonclinical) populations remains limited, leaving a critical gap in community-based prevention efforts. **OBJECTIVE:** This study evaluated the feasibility of using a smartphone app to predict mental health risks in nonclinical adolescents by integrating active and passive data streams within a machine learning (ML) framework. We examined the utility of this approach for identifying risks related to internalizing and externalizing difficulties, eating disorders, insomnia, and suicidal ideation. **METHODS:** Participants (n=103; mean age 16.1 years, SD 1.0) from 3 UK secondary schools used the Mindcraft app (Brain and Behaviour Lab) for 14 days, providing daily self-reports (eg, mood, sleep, and loneliness) and continuous passive sensor data (eg, location, step count, and app usage). We developed a deep learning model incorporating contrastive pretraining with triplet margin loss to stabilize user-specific behavioral patterns, followed by supervised fine-tuning for binary classification of 4 mental health outcomes, namely, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)-high risk, insomnia, suicidal ideation, and eating disorder. Performance was assessed using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (LOSO-CV), with balanced accuracy as the primary metric. Comparative analyses were conducted using CatBoost (Yandex) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) models without pretraining. Feature importance was assessed using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) values, and associations between key digital features and clinical scales were analyzed. **RESULTS:** Integration of active and passive data outperformed single-modality models, achieving mean balanced accuracies of 0.71 (0.03) for SDQ-high risk, 0.67 (0.04) for insomnia, 0.77 (0.03) for suicidal ideation, and 0.70 (0.03) for eating disorder. The contrastive learning approach improved representation stability and predictive robustness. SHAP analysis highlighted clinically relevant features, such as negative thinking and location entropy, underscoring the complementary value of combining subjective and objective data. Correlation analyses confirmed meaningful associations between key digital features and mental health outcomes. Performance in an independent external validation cohort (n=45) achieved balanced accuracies of 0.63-0.72 across outcomes, suggesting generalizability to new settings. **CONCLUSIONS:** This study demonstrates the feasibility and utility of smartphone-based digital phenotyping for predicting mental health risks in nonclinical, school-going adolescents. By integrating active and passive data with advanced machine modeling techniques, this approach shows promise for early detection and scalable intervention strategies in community settings.
