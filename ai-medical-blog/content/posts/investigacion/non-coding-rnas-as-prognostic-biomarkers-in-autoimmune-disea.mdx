## Resumen

Autoimmune diseases comprise a broad spectrum of disorders in which both the innate and adaptive branches of the immune system malfunction, mistakenly attacking the body's own tissues and organs. This breakdown in self-tolerance is marked by the generation of autoantibodies that drive tissue damage. Identifying individuals who are likely to develop more aggressive disease at an early stage is crucial, as it enables earlier therapeutic intervention and improves long-term clinical outcomes. Yet, traditional diagnostic tools (such as autoantibody levels, inflammatory mediators, and acute-phase biomarkers) often fall short in reliably forecasting disease trajectory or predicting response to therapy due to their limited sensitivity and specificity. These shortcomings have intensified interest in more advanced molecular markers, particularly those uncovered through genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic analyses. Among these novel biomarker candidates, non-coding RNAs have emerged as especially promising regulators and indicators of autoimmune pathology. Their potential highlights the importance of directing future research toward large-scale, multicenter, longitudinal studies that combine multi-omics methodologies with machine-learning-driven analyses to develop reliable and clinically meaningful prognostic signatures. Ultimately, the identification of diverse biomarkers and innovative analytical methods will play a pivotal role in enhancing the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of autoimmune diseases. This review synthesizes current evidence on the prognostic value of ncRNAs, emphasizing their ability to predict future clinical outcomes such as disease severity, risk of organ-specific damage (e.g., lupus nephritis, rheumatoid joint erosion), likelihood of disease flare, and therapeutic response. We detail the mechanisms by which specific ncRNAs influence key pathogenic processes and explore their clinical application as stable, accessible biomarkers in liquid biopsies.
