## Resumen

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degenerative neurological condition defined by a wide range of motor and non-motor symptoms that can affect function to varying degrees. One of the hallmarks of PD is postural instability (PI), along with rest tremor, stiffness, and bradykinesia. PI is a primary cause of disability and decreased quality of life in people with PD. This paper presents a review of the available literature to understand PD, its pathophysiology, diagnosis, various risk factors and its pharmacological and non-pharmacological management. This review offers an overview of physiotherapeutic methods and recent advances in PD care, highlighting the growing role of digital health technologies, artificial intelligence (AI), and innovative rehabilitation tools in improving diagnosis, treatment, and patient outcomes. Diagnosis of PD relies on clinical signs observed during history-taking and physical examination, along with motor fluctuations and response to dopamine therapies over time. Identifying risk factors specific to PI helps in diagnosis and prevention by differentiating between modifiable and non-modifiable causes. The management of PD includes both pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches. Physiotherapy is a common therapeutic approach for managing symptoms in patients with PD. Management of PD has seen various improvements with the emerging technologies, with ongoing studies driving further advancements.
