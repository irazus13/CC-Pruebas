## Resumen

**INTRODUCTION:** Fibrotic interstitial lung diseases (fILDs) are a heterogeneous group of rare lung diseases. Symptoms of ILD are non-specific, and diagnosis requires multiple investigations including invasive procedures. Therefore, diagnostic delay is common. Previous single-center studies showed that profiling of exhaled volatile organic compounds using non-invasive electronic nose (eNose) sensor technology has potential as diagnostic tool for ILD. We aimed to validate eNose technology to differentiate various ILDs in an international multicenter cohort. **METHODS:** We included patients with an ILD diagnosis established in a multidisciplinary team (MDT) discussion and pulmonary fibrosis on HRCT scan in five international ILD expert centers. An eNose (SpiroNose&#xae;) was used for exhaled breath analysis. We compared eNose breath profiles of different ILD subtypes versus all other ILDs as a group, and across six different ILD subtypes. Breath profiles were analyzed with partial least squares discriminant and receiver operating characteristic analyses. Models were trained on data from a selection of centers and externally validated in other centers. **RESULTS:** Breath profiles of 587 patients were analyzed. Comparing breath profiles of ILD subtypes versus all other ILDs resulted in area under the curve values (AUCs) ranging from 0.88-0.92 in the training set and 0.75-0.95 in the validation set. ILD subtypes could be discriminated with AUCs ranging from 0.95-0.98 in the training set and 0.83-0.93 in the validation set. **DISCUSSION:** This international study demonstrates that eNose technology accurately differentiates breath profiles from patients with various ILDs. eNose technology holds potential as easy point-of-care tool for diagnosis of fILDs.
