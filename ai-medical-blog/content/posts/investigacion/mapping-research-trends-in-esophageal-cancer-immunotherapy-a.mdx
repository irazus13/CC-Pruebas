## Resumen

Immunotherapy has become a pivotal therapy for various cancers, including esophageal cancer, showing promising potential in improving survival rates and enabling personalized care. However, significant challenges occur in identifying predictive biomarkers, refining combination therapies, and managing immunotherapy-related adverse effects. This bibliometric study analyzed publications related to the use of immunotherapy in esophageal cancer management over a 10-y period (January 1, 2015, to October 14, 2024), retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection. Keyword co-occurrence and co-citation analyses were performed to identify key contributors, central themes, and influential publications. A total of 545 publications on esophageal cancer immunotherapy were included in the analysis. A sharp increase in publication volume was observed beginning in 2019, with a peak between 2021 and 2023. China emerged as the leading contributor, accounting for 67.7% of the total output, while Zhengzhou University produced the highest number of publications among all institutions. Prominent individual contributors included Ken Kato and Shen Lin. Research hotspots centered on PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, combination therapies, and tumor microenvironment modulation. Notably, a clear temporal evolution in research focus was observed, with early studies emphasizing specific immune checkpoint targets and agents (e.g., PD-1, Pembrolizumab, and CTLA-4), followed by a shift toward mechanistic investigations involving the tumor microenvironment, treatment resistance, and prognosis. This study provides a comprehensive view of immunotherapy in the management of esophageal cancer, offering direction for future research and valuable insights for clinical innovation.
