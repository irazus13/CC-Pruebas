## Resumen

BBP-398 is a selective allosteric SHP2 inhibitor designed to inhibit mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway-driven tumors. We performed the first-in-human phase 1 trial described herein to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of BBP-398 in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring MAPK pathway mutations. Once-daily BBP-398 was administered at 350-550&#x2009;mg in the dose-escalation phase (1a; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;35) followed by a dose-expansion phase (1b; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;37). The study endpoints were dose-limiting toxicities, treatment-emergent adverse events, pharmacokinetics, target engagement, disease control rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival. In phase 1a, 26% of the 23 evaluable patients had stable disease, with a median progression-free survival duration of 1.8 months (range, 1.7-4.1 months). In phase 1b, 30% of the 27 evaluable patients had stable disease (31% at 350&#x2009;mg, 27% at 450&#x2009;mg), with median progression-free survival of 2.2 months and 1.9 months at 350&#x2009;mg and 450&#x2009;mg, respectively. We halted dose escalation at 550&#x2009;mg owing to an increased rate of thrombocytopenia and edema. At daily doses of up to 450&#x2009;mg, BBP-398 exhibited an acceptable safety profile and produced disease stabilization in nearly 30% of heavily pretreated patients.
