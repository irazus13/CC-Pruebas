## Resumen

**ABSTRACT:** Generative artificial intelligence (GAI), including large language models and multimodal generative systems, is rapidly emerging in healthcare with growing interest in its potential applications for dementia care. These technologies offer new possibilities for communication support, cognitive engagement and personalised interaction, yet they also introduce complex ethical, relational and practical challenges. Nurses&#x2014;who hold central, sustained roles across dementia care settings&#x2014;are key mediators of technology adoption and are positioned to assess the appropriateness, safety and ethical implications of GAI use. However, existing literature remains fragmented and largely focused on technological development or patient-facing outcomes, with limited synthesis of nurses&#x2019; roles, experiences and ethical perspectives. This scoping review aims to map the current evidence regarding how nurses engage with GAI in dementia care and to identify gaps that may inform practice, policy and future research. **METHODS AND ANALYSIS:** This review will follow the methodological framework of Arksey and O&#x2019;Malley, refined by Levac et al and guided by the Joanna Briggs Institute Manual for Evidence Synthesis. Reporting will adhere to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews checklist. The review will be conducted between March 2026 and October 2026, encompassing database searching, screening, data charting, synthesis and reporting. A comprehensive search will be conducted across MEDLINE (Ovid), CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus and Web of Science using controlled vocabulary and keywords related to nursing, generative artificial intelligence and dementia. Eligible sources will include empirical studies, reviews, conceptual papers and policy analyses that report nursing roles, experiences or ethical considerations related to GAI in dementia care. Two reviewers will independently screen titles/abstracts and full texts and extract data using a structured charting form. Findings will be synthesised through descriptive statistics and inductive thematic analysis, supported by conceptual mapping to illustrate relationships among GAI types, nursing roles, ethical concerns and care settings. Critical appraisal will not be undertaken, as it is optional in scoping reviews and is not aligned with the primary mapping objectives of this review. **ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION:** Ethical approval is not required as the review synthesises publicly available literature. Should the optional interest-holders consultation be undertaken, ethical clearance will be obtained from an appropriate institutional review board prior to participant engagement. Findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publication, conference presentations and knowledge-translation outputs targeted at clinicians, educators, policymakers and AI developers. The review will support informed, ethically grounded integration of GAI in dementia care.
