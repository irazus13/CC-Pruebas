## Resumen

Digital dermatology, which is defined as the use of digital technologies that leverage individual- and population-level skin data to improve the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of skin diseases, has emerged as a critical frontier for bridging persistent gaps in dermatologic care. This transformation holds particular promise for addressing long-standing inequities linked to geography, income, and skin type. According to the Global Burden of Disease 2023 study, skin and subcutaneous diseases remain among the most prevalent global health conditions, contributing substantially to disability-adjusted life years. Digital tools (including teledermatology, artificial intelligence [AI], and large language models) offer new ways to extend diagnosis, education, and patient empowerment to historically underserved populations. However, these same innovations risk amplifying disparities if they are not designed and deployed intentionally. Algorithmic bias, uneven digital access, and the absence of culturally responsive models can undermine progress. In this conceptual and narrative review, we draw on expert dialogues and illustrative literature, including multistakeholder exchanges at the Skin and Digital Summit (2023-2025) and related global forums, to examine how digital dermatology can promote equitable skin health. We focus on 3 interlinked priorities: expanding access through scalable digital platforms, ensuring AI fairness via comprehensive and diverse datasets, and countering dermatological misinformation. Central to the latter is a bot concept described here as a dynamic cycle that analyzes scientific literature; ranks evidence; translates complex research into clear language; and delivers trustworthy, personalized guidance to both consumers and clinicians. By embedding expert oversight and evidence prioritization, such tools can ensure that accurate, actionable information reaches users at the speed and scale of the internet. Drawing on case studies (including lessons from the World Health Organization's AI skin health app) and insights from the Skin and Digital Summit, we highlight both the transformative potential and the ethical complexities of these digital solutions. To navigate this evolving landscape, we propose the concept of radical dermatology, which confronts the reality that big tech is reshaping skin health whether we like it or not and insists that dermatologists and stakeholders lead the transformation through bold collaboration and unwavering clinical relevance.
