## Resumen

Blepharoptosis is a common eyelid disorder that impairs both vision and appearance, requiring accurate assessment for effective treatment. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a deep learning (DL)-based system for automatic measurement of eyelid and periorbital parameters and for classifying levator function (LF) in patients with blepharoptosis. We retrospectively included 1,177 patients who underwent ptosis surgery at a tertiary oculoplastic center from January 2016 to November 2021. LF was categorized into good (&gt;&#x2009;10&#xa0;mm), fair (4-10&#xa0;mm), and poor (&#x2264;&#x2009;4&#xa0;mm) based on clinical evaluation. The DL model segmented eyelid and eyebrow regions and measured key parameters; manual measurements were performed for comparison. A multinomial logistic regression model incorporating DL-derived features and demographic data was used to predict LF grades. The DL system achieved high segmentation performance (Dice coefficient&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.910) and strong agreement with manual measurements (ICC&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.988 for MRD1; 0.902 for CBH). The regression model classified LF grades with an overall accuracy of 0.760 and an AUC of 0.829, within the range of ophthalmologist assessments (highest clinician accuracy&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.767). This DL-based system offers an efficient, objective tool for periorbital assessment and LF grading, supporting personalized diagnosis and surgical planning in blepharoptosis management.
