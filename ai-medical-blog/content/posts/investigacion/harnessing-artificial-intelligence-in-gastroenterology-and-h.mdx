## Resumen

Artificial intelligence (AI) has made remarkable strides, becoming an essential tool in modern medicine. As AI continues to evolve, it is crucial to redefine its scope, classifications, and subtypes to better align with its clinical applications and potential. With a growing number of sophisticated models, AI is now widely used in gastroenterology and hepatology, offering new ways to enhance patient care. In gastroenterology, AI helps doctors identify lesions during endoscopy, detect gastrointestinal bleeding, and support the diagnosis and treatment of conditions like inflammatory bowel disease and gastrointestinal cancers. In hepatology, it aids in staging liver fibrosis, tracking disease progression, and predicting hepatocellular carcinoma risks. Machine learning further personalizes treatment plans, helping physicians make more informed decisions. However, despite its promise, AI still faces hurdles, including biases in data, ethical considerations, regulatory challenges, and the need for better transparency. Moving forward, refining these models, conducting extensive validation studies, and integrating AI seamlessly into clinical practice will be crucial in fully realizing its benefits for gastroenterology and hepatology.
