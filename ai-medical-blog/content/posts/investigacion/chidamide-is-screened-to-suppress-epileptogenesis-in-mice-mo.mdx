## Resumen

**AIMS:** Disease-modifying and anti-epileptogenic therapies for epilepsy remain limited. Given the critical role of histone deacetylases (HDACs) in epileptogenesis, this study aimed to identify effective HDAC inhibitors and evaluate their anti-epileptogenic potential. **METHODS:** A Mg2+-free neuron-like PC12 cell model was used to screen FDA-approved HDAC inhibitors in&#xa0;vitro. Acute and chronic epilepsy models were induced in mice using pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) or kainic acid (KA). Spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) were monitored by electroencephalogram (EEG). Neuronal survival, mossy fiber sprouting (MFS), and glial activation were assessed by Nissl staining, Timm staining, and immunofluorescence, respectively. HDAC1 expression was analyzed by Western blot and immunofluorescence. Neuron-specific HDAC1 overexpression was achieved using adeno-associated virus (AAV2; hereafter referred to as AAV)-mediated gene transfer. **RESULTS:** Chidamide (Chi) exhibited the most inhibitory effect among nine HDAC inhibitors. Chi significantly reduced seizure susceptibility in acute PTZ- and KA-induced models. In the chronic KA model, Chi attenuated SRS, improved neuronal survival, reduced MFS, and suppressed astrocytic and microglial activation. Chi markedly decreased hippocampal HDAC1 expression, while neuronal HDAC1 overexpression abolished its anti-epileptogenic effects. **CONCLUSION:** Chi attenuates epileptogenesis by inhibiting neuronal HDAC1 and may serve as a promising repurposed anti-epileptogenic therapy.
