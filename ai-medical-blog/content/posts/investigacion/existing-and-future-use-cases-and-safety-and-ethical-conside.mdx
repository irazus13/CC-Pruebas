## Resumen

Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming digital, clinical, and cultural landscapes in ways that hold significant implications for body image and eating disorder (ED) prevention. This article outlines how traditional and generative AI technologies influence societal appearance ideals as well as digital environments, including online mental health tools. While AI offers opportunities for early detection, personalized and scalable prevention, and the promotion of more inclusive representation, it also poses ethical and psychological risks, including amplification of harmful appearance ideals, algorithmic bias, and overreliance on technology. This article identifies key research priorities relevant to body image spanning macro-level impacts, emerging use cases, ethics and safety, equity and representation in datasets, public perceptions, and the need for interdisciplinary and participatory governance. As AI becomes embedded in everyday life, its responsible and safe use will be critical to ensuring it does not exacerbate body image concerns or increase ED risk.
