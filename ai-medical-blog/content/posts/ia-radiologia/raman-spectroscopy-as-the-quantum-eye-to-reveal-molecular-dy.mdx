## Resumen

Raman spectroscopy was a molecular vibrational spectroscopy technique based on inelastic light scattering, which obtained information on molecular chemical bond vibrations, rotations and other characteristics by detecting the frequency shifts generated by photons interacting with matter. Raman spectroscopy enabled energy exchange through quantum state transitions between photons and molecules. This technique revealed the microscopic properties of matter based on quantum mechanical principles. Furthermore, Raman spectroscopy combined with quantum enhancement methods can overcome traditional detection limitations, propelling molecular sensing into an era of precision. And this technique showed unique advantages in revealing life science research due to their non-invasive nature, no need for sample labeling, high chemical specificity and applicability to complex biological systems. In recent years, with the breakthroughs in micro-Raman, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS), Raman spectroscopy has made remarkable progress in biomolecular analysis, cell and tissue imaging, disease diagnosis and drug development, and microplastic detection. Despite the outstanding advantages of Raman spectroscopy in life science research, there are still several technical barriers in the translation from emerging technologies to practical applications. In the future, with the deep integration of nanoprobe design, deep learning algorithms and Raman technology, the application of Raman technology in single-cell metabolomics, rapid identification of microorganisms and precision medicine will be further expanded, which provides more powerful molecular insight tools for life science research.
