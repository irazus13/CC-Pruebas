## Resumen

The present study investigates the effect of thin porous ceramic coatings on implant stability, focusing on two materials: a calcium alkali orthophosphate (GB14, Ca2KNa(PO4)2) and &#x3b2;-tricalcium phosphate (&#x3b2;-TCP), with and without copper (Cu) incorporation. The coatings were applied to titanium implant surfaces (CP Ti, grade 2) and characterized for porosity and microstructure. The in vivo performance of the material is assessed in a New Zealand White rabbit model. Following defined healing periods, biomechanical push-out testing were performed. The results of &#x3b2;-TCP/Cu for cancellous bone show that Cu-doped coatings exhibit significantly improved bone integration compared to their Cu-free counterparts. The enhanced fixation is attributed to the bioactive and potential antibacterial properties of copper, which may stimulate osteogenesis and the presence of supraparticles in the Cu samples. Furthermore, the incorporation of &#x3b2; -TCP supraparticles into the ceramic matrix increases overall coating porosity, facilitating deeper bone ingrowth and improved mechanical interlocking. This structural change results in improved osseointegration compared to less porous coatings. This structural change results in improved osseointegration compared to less porous coatings. The results of this study demonstrate that combining copper incorporation with enhanced porosity through supraparticles can improve implant stability by shortening the time required for the transition from primary to secondary stability. This approach offers a promising strategy for optimizing surface design in orthopedic and dental implants.
