## Resumen

The rapidly evolving field of computational psychiatry enables quantification of specific cognitive processes, and their underlying mechanisms, in a translational and potentially scalable manner, using a combination of data collection via mechanistically informed behavioral tasks and theory-driven mathematical modeling. In parallel, transdiagnostic, dimensional approaches to psychiatric diagnostics, such as RDoC and HiTOP, seek to facilitate links between clinical research and real-world clinical reality, which rarely respects traditional diagnostic boundaries. These two approaches are seldom combined. In addition, while most psychiatric disorders are defined by their longitudinal course, our ability to predict symptom trajectories and tailor treatments to the individual remains limited, in part due to a dearth of longitudinal data collected using assessments sensitive to individual change over time. To address these gaps, the recently launched 'Individually Measured Phenotypes to Advance Computational Translation at Yale' (IMPACT-Y) study is collecting longitudinal data from a transdiagnostic cohort of 2400 individuals, using a combination of 'traditional' clinical research methods (e.g., health records, standardized assessments) and more novel computational approaches (e.g., behavioral tasks with demonstrated sensitivity to latent constructs and to within-person change, spoken narrative data). Here, we discuss unique challenges and opportunities in study design and analysis considerations of IMPACT-Y. Incorporating both theory- and data-driven analytics, we hope that IMPACT-Y will provide an unprecedented resource for characterizing longitudinal trajectories of core computational psychiatry constructs (e.g., reward learning) within and between individuals, for parsing heterogeneity beyond traditional diagnostic categories, and for linking inter- and intra-individual clinical variability to underlying mechanisms.
