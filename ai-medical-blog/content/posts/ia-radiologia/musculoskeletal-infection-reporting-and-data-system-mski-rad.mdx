## Resumen

**ABSTRACT:** A standardized guideline and scoring system are recommended for the imaging evaluation of musculoskeletal infections on MR imaging. The Musculoskeletal Infection Reporting and Data System (MSKI-RADS) is a recently developed and validated classification system using MR imaging that can be used to classify the severity and extent of musculoskeletal infections, improve radiology-pathology concordance, and outline the corresponding management recommendations. This review article explains MSKI-RADS and discusses the different elements of this system in detail with a review of pertinent literature so that the readers can apply it in their practices. The work outlines the technical considerations for optimal MR imaging for evaluating various musculoskeletal infectious lesions, details the severity scales with examples of various conditions that fall under each class, and outlines related patient management recommendations. The readers can learn about the MSKI-RADS classification system and apply the gained information from this article to improve MRI interpretations in their practice and increase the effectiveness of their multidisciplinary communications. This standardized system will also allow longitudinal data collection and tracking for future research purposes. **CRITICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT:** MSKI-RADS is a recently developed and validated MRI-based guideline for musculoskeletal infections in extremities. A comprehensive understanding of these classifications can facilitate improved standardized diagnostic reporting of musculoskeletal infections on MRI and better patient outcomes. **KEY POINTS:** Current terminology for describing musculoskeletal infections on MRI is nonspecific, resulting in confusing diagnostic reports. A standardized guideline and scoring system are critical for improving diagnostic reporting of musculoskeletal infections on MRI. MSKI-RADS is a recently developed and validated MRI-based guideline that can be used to characterize musculoskeletal infections in extremities. MSKI-RADS is a meaningful tool that facilitates improvements in standardized reporting and treatment protocols, multidisciplinary communications, and longitudinal data collection. **GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT:** [Image: see text]
