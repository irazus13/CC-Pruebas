## Resumen

**PURPOSE:** Clinical photographs play an integral role across medical fields. Since the mid-20th century, deidentification has consisted of black bars covering specific facial features, typically the eyes alone. Although increasingly questioned, this practice persists in clinical and academic settings. **APPROACH:** A barrier to standardized deidentification guideline development is the unknown risk of artificial intelligence (AI) to reconstruct faces from partially obscured photos. We evaluate the ability of generative AI to reconstruct 10,000 facial images in the Synthetic Faces High Quality dataset across 14 regional masking strategies. **RESULTS:** Covering the eyes or any other single facial feature resulted in highly identifiable reconstructions, demonstrated by low face mesh distortion (0.14 to 0.18 relative to whole-face masking; absolute total face mesh distortion 8.34 to 10.19) and high structural similarity index to the original face (1.24 to 1.25 relative to whole-face masking; absolute SSIM 0.91 to 0.92). An open-source face verification model using Dlib was able to match 97.98% to 99.93% of these reconstructed images with the original image prior to single feature masking. Removing all major facial features (eyebrows, eyes, nose, and mouth) resulted in a threefold reduction in face verification rates compared with eyes alone, from 98.87% (95% CI [98.63%, 99.07%]) to 33.93% (95% CI [32.95%, 34.94%]). **CONCLUSIONS:** We provide quantitative metrics of the reidentification risk that modern generative AI technology poses for partially obscured facial images.
