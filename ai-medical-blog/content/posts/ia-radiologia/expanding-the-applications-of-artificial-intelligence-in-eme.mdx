## Resumen

Owing to their swift, precise, and tireless capabilities, artificial intelligence (AI) applications in emergency radiology are becoming powerful tools for radiologists. These applications, which are useful for improving diagnostic efficiency, are also a core engine driving the entire field of emergency medicine toward higher levels of precision, personalization, and efficiency. The integration of AI into emergency radiology thus represents a transformative advancement in precision medicine. We explore herein the expanding applications of AI in emergency radiology, focusing on their potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy, streamline workflows, and improve patient outcomes. By analyzing its current utilization and future directions, we demonstrate how AI is revolutionizing emergency care through intelligent image analysis and decision support systems. Although certain challenges remain, including data security, model interpretability, and clinical implementation standards, the immense potential of AI to reshape emergency workflows, promote precision medicine, and improve patient outcomes is unmistakable.
