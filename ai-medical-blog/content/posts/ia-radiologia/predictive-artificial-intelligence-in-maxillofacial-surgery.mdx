## Resumen

The objective of this systematic review is to outline the current landscape and applications of predictive artificial intelligence (AI) in maxillofacial surgery. Studies on predictive AI models used in maxillofacial surgery were reviewed to understand how predictive AI is used and to identify emerging trends in its research. Of the studies identified, 25 were included in the review. The results show that predictive AI in the field of maxillofacial surgery has strong applications in the prediction of postoperative results from preoperative medical imaging modalities, and has generally shown high accuracy. It is also used for treatment and surgical planning, identifying which treatment is necessary and if surgery may be indicated in the future. It has the potential to cut down clinical time, improve workflow, and reduce the strain on clinicians. Predicting the future need for surgery allows for timely intervention and risk management, and ultimately enables early and effective patient communication. Overall, the studies show that AI has the potential to work alongside clinicians to improve clinical workflow and decision-making.
