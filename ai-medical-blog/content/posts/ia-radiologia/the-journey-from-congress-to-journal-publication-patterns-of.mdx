## Resumen

**OBJECTIVES:** To evaluate the publication outcomes of oral presentations delivered at the European Congress of Radiology (ECR) 2019 and examine factors influencing conversion to full-text articles; findings were also compared with ECR 2010. **MATERIALS AND METHODS:** A total of 1817 oral presentations from ECR 2019 were analyzed. Publication status was determined by searching PubMed/MEDLINE up to December 2023. For each matched article, Journal Impact Factor (JIF) and Google Scholar citations/year were recorded. Additional variables included country of origin, collaboration type, imaging modality, and study design. Statistical analyses used chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis, with p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05 considered significant. **RESULTS:** Of 1817 oral presentations, 844 (46.5%) were published, with no significant difference from ECR 2010 (43%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.091). Abstracts originated from 71 countries, with Italy (16.5%) and China (15.5%) contributing the most. Publications appeared in 254 journals. Publication rates varied significantly by country (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), with Switzerland (74.4%) and the Netherlands (68.8%) achieving the highest rates. When analyzed by continent, abstracts from Asia showed a significantly higher publication rate than those from Europe (52.3% vs. 43.6%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001). Publication outcomes also varied significantly by imaging modality (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002) and subspecialty (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Breast imaging achieved the highest median JIF (4.9), whereas Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) demonstrated the highest median annual citation count (10.5). **CONCLUSIONS:** Nearly half of the ECR 2019 oral presentations achieved peer-reviewed publication, maintaining rates from 2010. The congress's contributor landscape has become more global, with greater participation from Asia. While traditional radiological fields remain prevalent, AI/ML abstracts demonstrated high citation rates. These findings reflect contemporary trends in radiological research. **CRITICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT:** By analyzing the publication outcomes of ECR 2019, with comparisons to 2010 data, this study examines evolving global patterns in publication outcomes, offering insights to enhance the dissemination of radiological research. **KEY POINTS:** Converting oral presentations to publications remains challenging in radiological research. Nearly half of the ECR 2019 oral presentations were published, showing a modest, non-significant increase from ECR 2010. The congress has become increasingly global, with notable growth in participation from Asia. This study reveals radiology's evolving scientific landscape and current research priorities.
