## Resumen

Schizostachyum funghomii McClure is a bamboo species vital to traditional craftsmanship. However, it is highly susceptible to mould, which degrades material quality and poses health risks from mycotoxins. While hyperspectral imaging (HSI) combined with deep learning (DL) offers a promising detection method, yet aligning feature selection with model design remains a challenge. This study introduces a co-design engineering framework that leverages Occlusion Sensitivity (OS) analysis to integrate model optimization and feature selection. The framework was implemented in two stages. First, OS analysis served as a diagnostic tool, revealing that baseline networks over-relied on spatial textures. This diagnosis informed the targeted architectural refinement of a ResNet model into a lightweight version (ResNet-HS). By shifting focus from spatial patterns toward core spectral features, ResNet-HS improved validation accuracy on full-spectrum data from 87.04% to 95.06%. Second, an OS-guided algorithm was developed to select characteristic wavelengths based on their direct contribution to model decisions. A concise set of seven wavelengths was identified. The final lightweight model, using only these bands, achieved a validation accuracy of 90.74%, maintaining robust performance despite a 97% reduction in spectral data. This result exceeded a CARS-SPA-based model (87.65% with 14 bands) and was comparable to a PCA Loading-based model (91.36% with 12 bands). By transforming OS into an active co-optimization engine, this research establishes an integrated framework for developing hyperspectral systems that balance accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability.
