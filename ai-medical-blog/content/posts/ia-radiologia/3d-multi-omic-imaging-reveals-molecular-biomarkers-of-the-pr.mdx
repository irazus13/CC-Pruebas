## Resumen

The recurrence rate following complete surgical resection of primary non-small cell lung cancer is as high as 55%, yet no approach currently exists to evaluate the risk of local recurrence. The premetastatic paradigm is the recognition that metastasis is preceded by reprogramming na&#xef;ve tissues to prime a microenvironment for tumor cell survival and subsequent reactivation. Identification of biomarkers of the pre-metastatic niche would allow us to evaluate a patient's risk of local relapse in the normal lung parenchyma surrounding the resected tumor. We designed a workflow incorporating in vivo modelling, radiology, and deep learning-guided three-dimensional (3D) imaging, spatial proteomics, and transcriptomics to identify previously unreported signals associated with the early transformation of the lung parenchyma announcing regional metastasis. We curated biorepository spanning timepoints before and after resection of primary Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC) tumors. Using radiology and cellular resolution 3D histology, we calculated the number and distribution of metastases in mouse lungs and developed an algorithm to guide placement of spatial proteomics and transcriptomics to regions containing early micro-metastases and the pre-metastatic microenvironment. Molecular and tissue features associated with presence, size, and location of metastases guided the identification of both myeloid (F4/80) and senescent (p16/p21) cell signatures in the premetastatic and metastatic environments. Finally, multiparametric flow cytometry of metastatic lungs in a senescence reporter GEMM (tdTomato-p16 INKA mice) resolved senescent cells including alveolar macrophages as the cellular phenotypes associated with these early premetastatic signatures. Altogether, this work highlights a novel AI-assisted approach for detection of biomarkers of tissue remodeling during lung cancer invasion.
