## Resumen

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining is crucial for determining tumor subtypes, obtaining protein expression information, and developing personalized treatment plans. But compared with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining, IHC staining is more complex and expensive. With the advancement of deep learning, converting H&amp;E stained images into IHC stained images has gradually emerged as a solution for obtaining IHC staining. However, current virtual staining processes suffer from difficulties in aligning pathological semantic features, posing significant challenges for network training, which poses significant challenges for network training. To solve these issues, we propose a multi-view multi-level pathology semantic perception learning method for H&amp;E-to-IHC virtual staining (M2PL-GAN). Unlike prior approaches, M2PL-GAN introduces a comprehensive semantic learning paradigm from three views: structural contextual relations, feature distribution, and topology-aware fine-grained semantics. These correspond to the Context-aware Correlation Mechanism (CACM), the Local-aware Distribution Alignment Mechanism (LDAM), and the Graph-aware Bidirectional Contrastive Learning Mechanism (GBCLM) respectively. Among them, CACM enhances contextual consistency by establishing semantic correlations between virtual and real IHC images at local scales. LDAM ensures alignment of semantic feature distributions between virtual and real IHC images, mitigating semantic shifts caused by HE-IHC staining. GBCLM leverages graph neural network to capture topology-aware semantic representations and optimizes semantic feature alignment through bidirectional contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on both public and private datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations. Our code is available in https://github.com/Pikachu-one/M2PL-GAN.
