## Resumen

**BACKGROUND:** Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) presents significant segmentation challenges due to its heterogeneous structure and low contrast with surrounding tissues. Manual segmentation is time-consuming and inconsistent, while conventional deep learning models often lack clinical context and struggle with small tumor regions. **METHOD:** The proposed CAAG-UNet3D is a residual 3D U-Net architecture that incorporates synthetic multi-modal imaging (T1, T1ce, T2, FLAIR) and condition-specific attention mechanisms. Residual convolution blocks and attention gates are integrated into the encoder-decoder structure to enhance feature learning and focus on tumor-specific regions. A hybrid loss function combining Focal Tversky Loss and Dice Loss is employed to handle class imbalance and improve segmentation of small tumor areas. The model is trained using the AdamW optimizer with OneCycleLR scheduling and evaluated on standard segmentation metrics. **RESULTS:** On a synthetic multi-modal CT dataset, CAAG-UNet3D achieved a mean Dice score of 0.832, IoU of 0.766, and VOE of 12%, outperforming benchmark models such as TransBTS, nnUNet, and 3D-ResUNet. Ablation studies confirmed the contribution of multi-modality, attention mechanisms, and residual learning to overall performance. **CONCLUSION:** CAAG-UNet3D demonstrates that the integration of synthetic multi-modal radiomic inputs and attention-guided residual learning yields superior automated PDAC segmentation, paving the way for more reliable quantitative imaging biomarkers in clinical radiomics.
