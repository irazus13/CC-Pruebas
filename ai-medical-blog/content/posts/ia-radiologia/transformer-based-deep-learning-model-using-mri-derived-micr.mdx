## Resumen

IntroductionLymphovascular invasion (LVI), an aggressive pathological manifestation of breast cancer, is closely associated with increased risk of distant metastasis and poor prognosis. This study proposes a novel modeling strategy that integrates MRI-derived microvascular atlas parameters with the TwinsSVT deep learning architecture to enable noninvasive prediction of LVI status in breast cancer patients and to explore its biological interpretability.Materials and MethodsA total of 436 breast cancer patients from two medical centers, all pathologically confirmed postoperatively, were retrospectively enrolled. All patients underwent high-resolution multi-b-value diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) prior to surgery. From the MRI data, four types of microvascular simulation parameter maps were reconstructed within tumor regions: apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), mean flow velocity (v_m), velocity dispersion (v_s), and angiographic branching index (ANB), aiming to characterize intratumoral microcirculation and vascular structural complexity. These functional parametric maps were individually input into separate encoder branches of the TwinsSVT model to extract multi-scale spatial features. A multi-layer Transformer fusion module was then employed to capture structural interactions across modalities, thereby constructing a multi-parametric fusion model. Model performance was evaluated using metrics including area under the curve (AUC) and F1 score.ResultsCompared with single-parameter models, the multi-parametric fusion model demonstrated significantly improved predictive performance, with AUCs of 0.881 (95% CI: 0.781-0.982) and 0.859 (95% CI: 0.764-0.953) in internal and external validation cohorts, respectively. Grad-CAM visualizations revealed that the model predominantly focused on tumor margins and regions of high vascular density, suggesting a strong correlation between the model's attention and actual pathological structures.ConclusionThe deep learning model constructed based on MRI-derived microvascular simulation atlases enables noninvasive preoperative prediction of LVI status in breast cancer patients. By effectively capturing structural information and offering biological interpretability, the model holds promise as a robust imaging-based tool for precision subtyping and clinical decision support.
