## Resumen

**BACKGROUND:** General anesthesia comprises 3 essential components-hypnosis, analgesia, and immobility. Among these, maintaining an appropriate hypnotic state, or anesthetic depth, is crucial for patient safety. Excessively deep anesthesia may lead to hemodynamic instability and postoperative cognitive dysfunction, whereas inadequate anesthesia increases the risk of intraoperative awareness. Electroencephalography (EEG)-based monitoring has therefore become a cornerstone for evaluating anesthetic depth. However, processed electroencephalography (pEEG) indices remain vulnerable to various sources of interference, including electromyographic activity, interindividual variability, and anesthetic drug effects, which can yield inaccurate numerical outputs. **OBJECTIVE:** With recent advances in machine learning, particularly unsupervised learning, data-driven methods that classify signals according to inherent patterns offer new possibilities for anesthetic depth analysis. This study aimed to establish a methodology for automatically identifying anesthesia depth using an unsupervised, machine learning-based clustering approach applied to pEEG data. **METHODS:** Standard frontal EEG data from participants undergoing elective lumbar spine surgery were retrospectively analyzed, yielding more than 16,000 data points. The signals were filtered with a fourth-order Butterworth bandpass filter and transformed using the fast Fourier transform to estimate power spectral density. Normalized band power ratios for delta, high-theta, alpha, and beta frequencies were extracted as input features. Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering (c=3, m=2) was applied to categorize anesthetic depth into slight, proper, and deep clusters. **RESULTS:** FCM clustering successfully identified 3 physiologically interpretable clusters consistent with EEG dynamics during progressive anesthesia. As anesthesia deepened, frontal alpha oscillations became more prominent within a delta-dominant background, while beta activity decreased with loss of consciousness. The fuzzy membership values quantified transitional states and captured the continuum of anesthetic depth. Visualization confirmed strong correspondence among cluster transitions, Patient State Index trends, and spectral density patterns. **CONCLUSIONS:** This study demonstrates the feasibility of using unsupervised machine learning to enhance anesthetic depth assessment. By applying FCM clustering to pEEG data, this approach improves the understanding of anesthesia depth and integrates effectively with existing monitoring modalities. The proposed FCM-based method complements current EEG indices and may assist anesthesia practitioners and even nonanesthesia professionals in assessing anesthetic depth to enhance patient safety.
