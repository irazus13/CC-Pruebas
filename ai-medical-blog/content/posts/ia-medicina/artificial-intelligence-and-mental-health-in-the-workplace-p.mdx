## Resumen

The mental health of workers is a crucial objective of occupational health and safety programs. Mental health issues in the workforce present a significant public and occupational health challenge, with considerable impacts on workers, families, employers, and society. Meanwhile, the growing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in various work environments prompts important questions regarding its impact on workers' mental well-being. AI can positively contribute to workplace mental health in various ways, including the early detection of fatigue, stress, and anxiety through wearable sensors. However, it also raises potential drawbacks, such as concerns about job displacement and job insecurity. Therefore, this narrative review aims to provide a comprehensive review of existing literature to highlight the potential benefits and challenges associated with the adoption of AI in the workplace and its implications for mental health.
