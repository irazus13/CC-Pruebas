## Resumen

Molecularly imprinted technology &#xff08;MIT&#xff09; represents an advanced synthetic strategy that emulates biological recognition mechanisms&#xff0c; such as antigen-antibody or enzyme-substrate interactions&#xff0c; by creating three-dimensional cavity-like structures through the directional assembly of functional monomers around a template molecule. This process generates spatial and functional complementarity&#xff0c; enabling highly selective recognition of target species. Molecularly imprinted polymers &#xff08;MIPs&#xff09;&#xff0c; often described as "synthetic antibodies"&#xff0c; overcome the intrinsic limitations of natural biomolecules by offering superior selectivity&#xff0c; robustness&#xff0c; cost-effectiveness&#xff0c; and structural tunability. These features position MIPs as promising alternatives to natural antibodies in targeted sensing and drug delivery&#xff0c; with broad applications across biomedical&#xff0c; environmental&#xff0c; and pharmaceutical domains&#xff0c; including pollutant detection&#xff0c; and food safety monitoring. Despite substantial progress&#xff0c; key challenges remain&#xff0c; such as uneven imprinting layers&#xff0c; template residue&#xff0c; and limited aqueous compatibility in macromolecular imprinting. Furthermore&#xff0c; issues of industrial scalability&#xff0c; unclear recognition mechanisms&#xff0c; and insufficient integration with emerging fields such as microfluidics and artificial intelligence have hindered large-scale translation. In recent years&#xff0c; our research team has systematically advanced MIT through a tri-dimensional strategy encompassing high-throughput monomer screening&#xff0c; mechanistic elucidation of molecular recognition&#xff0c; and directional assembly of functional units. By establishing a standardized monomer library and integrating molecular dynamics simulations&#xff0c; we achieved precise material design under complex conditions. Through process optimization and material innovation&#xff0c; we developed a highly efficient solid-phase surface imprinting method that enables the fabrication of smart MIPs with stimuli-responsive properties &#xff08;e.g.&#xff0c; temperature and pH&#xff09;. These MIPs exhibit markedly enhanced binding affinity&#xff0c; with equilibrium dissociation constant &#xff08;KD&#xff09; reaching 10-12 mol/L&#xff0c; over four orders of magnitude higher than those of non-imprinted polymers &#xff08;NIPs&#xff09;. Building on these advances&#xff0c; we established cross-disciplinary application platforms&#xff0c; including affinity-based protein separation and purification systems capable of efficient dual-enzyme cascade immobilization and inactivated enzyme renaturation. In the biomedical domain&#xff0c; we developed ultrasensitive biosensing methods achieving picogram-level detection of heart failure biomarkers and single-digit &#xff08;&#x2248;5 cells/mL&#xff09; detection of cancer cells in whole blood&#xff0c; extending these methods toward integrated tumor theranostics and microbial community regulation. This paper comprehensively summarizes our team's recent innovations in the rational design&#xff0c; functionalized fabrication&#xff0c; and cross-disciplinary applications of MIPs&#xff0c; spanning biosensing&#xff0c; biocatalysis&#xff0c; and biomedical diagnostics/therapeutics&#xff0c; while contextualizing these within the latest global advances in biomedicine and catalysis. Looking forward&#xff0c; we identify three strategic research frontiers for next-generation MIT. &#xff08;i&#xff09; Smart responsive material systems&#xff1a; design MIPs capable of multi-stimuli responsiveness &#xff08;e.g.&#xff0c; magnetic&#xff0c; photothermal&#xff0c; and pH cues&#xff09; to enable programmable drug release&#xff0c; real-time signal monitoring&#xff0c; and dynamic feedback regulation. &#xff08;ii&#xff09; Quantitative modeling of dynamic recognition&#xff1a; establish multi-scale theoretical frameworks to elucidate coupling between cavity flexibility and target conformational dynamics&#xff0c; guiding structure optimization and function-oriented design of adaptive MIPs. &#xff08;iii&#xff09; Integrated intelligent theranostic platforms&#xff1a; integrate microfluidics and biomimetic recognition modules into closed-loop systems capable of biomarker detection&#xff0c; targeted delivery&#xff0c; and real-time therapeutic feedback&#xff0c; bridging the gap between in vitro sensing and in vivo precision intervention. Synergistic advancement along these trajectories will empower MIT to transcend its role as a "static recognition material" and evolve into an intelligent&#xff0c; adaptive&#xff0c; and systematic biomedical platform. Such evolution will accelerate the translation of MIT innovations from laboratory to clinic and industry&#xff0c; propelling progress in personalized medicine&#xff0c; point-of-care diagnostics&#xff0c; and synthetic biology&#xff0c; and yielding profound scientific and societal impact.
