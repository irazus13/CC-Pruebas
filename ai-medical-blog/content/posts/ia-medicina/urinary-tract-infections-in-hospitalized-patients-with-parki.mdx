## Resumen

**BACKGROUND:** Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common complications among hospitalized patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and are associated with delirium and prolonged hospitalization. **OBJECTIVES:** To determine the prevalence of UTI, identify modifiable risk factors, and evaluate associated outcomes among hospitalized patients with PD. **METHODS:** We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the PINC-AI Healthcare Database including PD-related hospitalizations from 2019 to 2023. UTIs diagnosed on admission or during hospitalization were identified, and multivariable analyses were performed. **RESULTS:** Among more than 321,000 PD hospitalizations, 18.9% were associated with UTI. Emergent admission, inter-facility transfer, dementia, and indwelling urinary catheter use were independently associated with UTI, whereas male sex was protective. UTI was associated with prolonged length of stay and delirium. **CONCLUSIONS:** UTIs are frequent among hospitalized patients with PD and are associated with several modifiable risk factors. These findings may inform PD-specific inpatient strategies for UTI prevention and risk stratification.
