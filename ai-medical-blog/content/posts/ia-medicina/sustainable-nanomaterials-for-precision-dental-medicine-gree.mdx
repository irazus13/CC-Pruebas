## Resumen

Sustainable nanomaterials are emerging as transformative platforms for precision dental medicine, uniquely combining environmental responsibility with individualized therapeutic performance. Green-synthesized metallic, polymeric, carbon-based, and bioactive nanomaterials exhibit superior biocompatibility, biodegradability, and a reduced ecological burden compared to conventionally produced analogues, while enabling enhanced antimicrobial, regenerative, and diagnostic capabilities. This review synthesizes recent advances in eco-friendly nanoparticle synthesis, life-cycle sustainability metrics, and the integration of nanotechnology into patient-specific diagnostics, controlled-release therapeutics, and regenerative dentistry. Emphasis is placed on biogenic routes for silver, gold, ZnO, chitosan, bioactive glass, cellulose nanocrystals, and lignin nanocarriers, as well as their clinical potential in caries management, periodontal regeneration, endodontic disinfection, implant surface engineering, and point-of-care diagnostics. Additionally, their compatibility with multi-omics-driven precision dentistry is highlighted. We further analyze safety profiles, biodegradation pathways, regulatory frameworks, and translational challenges related to standardization and AI-assisted personalization. Sustainable nano-platforms represent a strategic route to advance dental care toward predictive, preventive, and personalized practice while ensuring environmental stewardship and global healthcare equity.
