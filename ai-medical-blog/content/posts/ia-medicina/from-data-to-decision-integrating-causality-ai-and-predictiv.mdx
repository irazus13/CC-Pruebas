## Resumen

**PURPOSE:** The proposed review aims to provide a guide on current developments of artificial intelligence in Endourological practice, with an insight and descriptive guide on the potential integration of advanced technologies into Endourology. The purpose of this review article is also to gather the recent advances in artificial intelligence applications in urology, and to highlight the potential applications of novel trends and technologies being developed in artificial intelligence. **METHODS:** Artificial intelligence is conquering the scientific landscape, and the medical field is not an exception. The work starts with a concise review of the state of the art and recent development of artificial intelligence and machine learning in urology and endourology. Moreover, an advanced description of novel technologies is presented in a clear manner, easy to follow by clinicians. The novel technologies include the causal artificial intelligence modeling, based on scientific constraints and directed acyclic graphs, as well as solving inverse problems and optimal decision making through reinforcement learning. **RESULTS:** The proposed manuscripts showcase potential applications of novel technologies in artificial intelligence, leading to democratizing its adoption. Theses novel technologies ease the explanation of the predictions performed by artificial intelligence algorithms, and follow causality and time sequencing constraints. Moreover, they can be useful to integrate expert's partial knowledge of complex medical phenomenon into their architecture by construction. **CONCLUSIONS:** The guide also showcases the potential applications and limitation in the field of urology. The proposed work ends in the current challenges hindering the democratization of artificial intelligence in Endourology.
