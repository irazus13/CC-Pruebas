## Resumen

Cancer navigation guides patients through cancer care, addressing barriers like late diagnosis, financial constraints, and emotional distress. In Africa, it supports early detection, treatment, and survivorship amid poor infrastructure and limited access. Expanding these programs can reduce mortality and improve outcomes. Cancer cases are rising rapidly in Africa and are expected to double by 2050. Access to care is hindered by limited facilities, few trained oncologists, geographic barriers, cultural stigma, high treatment costs, and lack of screening programs. Most services are urban-centered, leaving rural areas underserved. Financial hardship, poor governance, inadequate research funding, and scarce cancer registries worsen the problem. Coordinated, sustainable efforts are needed to improve cancer prevention, treatment, and care. Patient navigation significantly enhances cancer care in sub-Saharan Africa by addressing barriers to early detection, diagnosis, treatment, and support. Navigators facilitate screening, improve awareness, and coordinate care across healthcare levels. They reduce treatment delays, offer psychosocial support to patients and caregivers, and help with financial, transport, and lodging challenges. Successful programs in South Africa, Uganda, and Nigeria demonstrate improved outcomes, including increased screenings, faster diagnoses, and better treatment adherence, showcasing the transformative impact of navigation on cancer control in resource-limited settings. Strengthening cancer navigation systems is essential, focusing on healthcare infrastructure, workforce training, policy reform, and community engagement. Key strategies include expanding cancer centers, integrating trained patient navigators (both clinical and non-clinical navigators), leveraging telemedicine and AI, and increasing collaborations. Formal navigator certification, education campaigns, and improved health financing are crucial. These efforts aim to improve cancer detection, treatment, and outcomes across Africa's diverse healthcare settings.
