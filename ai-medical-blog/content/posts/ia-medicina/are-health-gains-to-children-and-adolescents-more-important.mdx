## Resumen

**PURPOSE:** Healthcare decision-making often assumes equal value for quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) across patient groups, yet societal preferences suggest that the value of a QALY may vary with characteristics such as age. Evidence indicates some willingness to prioritise child health gains, though findings are inconsistent. This study used person trade-off (PTO) to estimate the relative social value of different types of health gains for children and adolescents (aged 0-24&#xa0;years) compared with adults. **METHODS:** A representative Australian sample aged 16&#xa0;years and above (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;2098) completed an online survey comparing life extension and quality-of-life improvements for different ages. A 'chaining' approach tested response consistency, and logistic regression explored associations between PTO choices and respondent characteristics. Attitudinal questions and open text responses provided additional insights. **RESULTS:** PTO responses show that health gains for children and adolescents (4-24&#xa0;years) are generally valued more highly than those for adults (age 40 or 55&#xa0;years), with weights ranging from 1 to 1.3. For very young children, findings vary by health gain type: life extensions for infants (1&#xa0;month or 2&#xa0;years) are weighted lower, but pain alleviation is higher (weights &#x2265;&#xa0;1.2). Qualitative and attitudinal data reveal diverse views, with many opposing age-weighting. Younger respondents and those with young children prioritise children more, while older and female participants preferred equal treatment. **CONCLUSIONS:** The relative value of child QALY gains varies by age of the child, by health gain type, and by adult comparison age. While alleviating children's pain is strongly supported (weights &#x2265;&#xa0;1.2), overall views are polarised, highlighting the complexity of age-based prioritisation.
