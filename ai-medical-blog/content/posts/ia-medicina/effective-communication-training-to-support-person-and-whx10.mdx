## Resumen

**AIMS:** We sought to investigate the current state of education to support person- and wh&#x101;nau-centred care (PWCC) in our setting and to inform a new approach to teaching and learning. Additionally, we investigated the potential use case of an artificial intelligence (AI) tool to enable clinical communication skill development. **METHODS:** A mixed-method co-design approach was used, combining data from a consumer group, an anonymous staff survey (n=312) and a clinician focus group. The project captured lived experiences of communication in clinical care, enablers and barriers to effective training, and perspectives on future educational innovations including AI. **RESULTS:** Consumers emphasised the importance of individualised, culturally safe communication and clear, jargon-free language. Findings confirmed that while clinicians generally gain confidence with experience, existing training in communication and PWCC is inconsistent and often inaccessible. Clinicians identified a need for more frequent feedback and practical opportunities for skill development. This feedback should be from a person and wh&#x101;nau perspective. Notably, 90% of clinicians expressed openness to using an AI-based tool for improving communication skills. **CONCLUSION:** Traditional workplace education models are insufficient to meet the growing need for effective PWCC, including culturally safe communication in healthcare. An AI-enabled, feedback-driven tool may present a viable complementary solution to current offerings, provided it is co-designed with consumers and clinicians, is culturally grounded and is integrated into existing systems. Further investigation into the development and validation of a tool is warranted.
