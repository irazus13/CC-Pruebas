## Resumen

Since emerging in late 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has swiftly turned into a global public health emergency, exerting extensive influences on personal well-being and healthcare setups across the globe. In spite of the endeavors made by global health systems to tackle this issue, the COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare the weaknesses of these systems and spurred profound reflection on strategies for preventing and controlling novel viral diseases.This review focuses on how COVID-19 impacts cancer treatment and prognosis and delves into the virus's effect on the immune system particularly immune cells and cytokines. Research indicates that a COVID-19 infection not only heightens the treatment complexity for cancer patients but also impacts their prognosis by interfering with the immune response mechanism. It leads to a decrease in the number and function of immune cells such as T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells (NK cells), which may weaken the anti-tumor immune response and promote tumor progression. Additionally, COVID-19 has triggered a cytokine storm, causing a massive release of inflammatory factors and further exacerbating immune system dysfunction. However, the review also identified potential benefits. For instance, COVID-19 vaccination may have initiated anti-tumor immune responses in humans, presenting novel avenues for cancer treatment. Additionally, investigating the mechanisms behind COVID-19 infection yields valuable knowledge that can guide the development of innovative anti-tumor therapies. In conclusion, COVID-19 has had a multifaceted and profound effect on cancer treatment and prognosis. By thoroughly investigating the virus's impact on the immune system and developing new anti-tumor treatments, we stand a better chance of addressing this challenge and improving cancer patients' survival rates and quality of life.However, due to time constraints, this study lacks long-term research data to better substantiate that COVID-19 can worsen the prognosis of cancer patients. Looking ahead, conducting long-term cohort studies and stratified research (based on cancer type, stage, etc.) can yield more valuable clinical data.
