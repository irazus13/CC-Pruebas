## Resumen

**BACKGROUND:** The incidence of thyroid cancer has increased markedly in recent years, largely driven by well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma (WDTC). WDTC is biologically heterogeneous, with generally favorable prognosis but substantial variability in clinical behavior. Advances in molecular imaging, artificial intelligence-assisted diagnostics, and liquid biopsy have altered diagnostic strategies, while targeted therapy and immunotherapy have expanded treatment options for selected patients with advanced disease. The multidisciplinary team (MDT) model has therefore become an essential component of WDTC management through the integration of expertise from multiple specialties. **METHODS:** This review examines the role of MDT application in WDTC through analysis of relevant literature and international clinical guidelines, focusing on MDT composition, implementation models, clinical roles across diagnostic and therapeutic pathways, and current limitations. Differences in MDT recommendations among guidelines from various regions were also compared. **RESULTS:** MDT involvement supports personalized decision-making in WDTC, particularly in cases with indeterminate diagnosis, risk-adapted treatment selection, recurrent disease, and radioiodine-refractory progression. Persistent challenges include overtreatment of low-risk disease, suboptimal management of high-risk cases, limited MDT implementation in primary hospitals, uneven specialty participation, and variability in decision-making within guideline gray zones. **CONCLUSION:** The MDT model provides a structured framework to improve risk-adapted management of WDTC. Future efforts should prioritize refined risk-stratified MDT models, integration of decision-support tools, and expansion of remote platforms to enhance consistency and quality of management.
