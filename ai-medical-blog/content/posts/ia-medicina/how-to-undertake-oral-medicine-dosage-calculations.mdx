## Resumen

**RATIONALE AND KEY POINTS:** Safe and effective medicine administration and dosage calculation are fundamental nursing proficiencies. Medicine dosage calculations must be undertaken with utmost care to ensure patients' safety and that they gain maximum benefit from the prescribed medicine. It is essential, therefore, that nurses can undertake medicine dosage calculations accurately. Nurses undertaking this activity must ensure they have the knowledge and skills to do so and work within their competence level. &#x2022; Inaccurate medicine dosage calculations are a significant causative factor in medication errors. &#x2022; Wrong dose medication errors are frequently reported in both adult and children's healthcare settings, with higher rates of overdosing errors compared with underdosing errors. &#x2022; Causative factors of inaccurate drug calculations include mathematical-related errors, such as inadequate understanding of basic mathematics, and conceptual errors, where the nurse does not evaluate whether the final calculated dosage makes sense or is a safe and realistic amount for the patient within the context of their health status. &#x2022; Technology-enhanced simulation training, independent double checking, use of calculators, and use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) as an additional verification layer, have been identified as strategies that may reduce medicine dosage calculation errors. **REFLECTIVE ACTIVITY:** &#x2022; How to' articles can help to update your practice and ensure it remains evidence-based. Apply this article to your practice. Reflect on and write a short account of: &#x2022; How this article might enhance your practice when undertaking oral medicine dosage calculations. &#x2022; How you could use this information to educate nursing students or your colleagues on the correct methods to achieve accurate medicine dosage calculations.
