## Resumen

**AIM:** To propose a normative framework that guides nursing professional organisations to act as human rights intermediaries in the governance of artificial intelligence in healthcare. **DESIGN:** Discursive paper. **RESULTS:** The paper presents a triaxial framework that conceptualises the role of nursing professional organisations in artificial intelligence governance. The framework consists of a domain axis, which identifies key areas of engagement; a modality axis, which aligns actions with the specific functions of these organisations; and a human rights axis, which defines their role towards rights claimants and duty bearers. **CONCLUSION:** The proposed framework provides a practical tool for nursing professional organisations to strategically plan and implement initiatives to influence the advancement and regulation of artificial intelligence. Its application can help ensure that healthcare innovation is equitable and rights-based. **IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PROFESSION:** This paper provides a blueprint for nursing leaders and policymakers to engage proactively with the ethical dimensions of artificial intelligence. It emphasises the salient roles of nursing professional organisations in advocating for the human right to health in a technologically driven healthcare landscape. **IMPACT:** This paper addresses the gap in how the nursing profession can systematically engage with artificial intelligence governance. The main finding is a novel framework that provides a structured way for nursing professional organisations to act as human rights intermediaries. This research will have a significant impact on nursing leadership, patient advocacy groups, and policymakers involved in healthcare technology and ethics. **PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION:** Initial parts of this paper were presented to allied health practitioners via a webinar, providing early feedback and dialogue that informed its development.
