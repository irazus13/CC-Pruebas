## Resumen

Machine learning and statistical prediction tools proliferate across healthcare, yet the leap from development to sustained clinical impact remains elusive. This narrative review synthesizes empirical evidence on how prediction models have been embedded into routine decision&#x2011;making and what lessons can be drawn for implementation teams. Searches of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and specialized informatics journals (2010-2025) identified studies describing the real-world deployment of multivariable prediction models and reporting implementation outcomes. Evidence centered on sepsis detection, deterioration, readmission, and emergency triage models. Embedding strategies ranged from interruptive pop&#x2011;ups and non&#x2011;interruptive dashboard displays to worklists and order&#x2011;set linkage. Successful deployments invested heavily in stakeholder co&#x2011;design, threshold selection, training, and performance monitoring. Comparative studies indicated that deployment of a deep&#x2011;learning sepsis model (COMPOSER (COnformal Multidimensional Prediction Of SEpsis Risk)) decreased in&#x2011;hospital mortality and improved guideline adherence relative to baseline. Major barriers included workflow misalignment, alert fatigue, lack of transparency, data quality issues, and insufficient governance structures. Few papers described ongoing monitoring. The evidence suggests that prediction models confer value only when embedded through carefully designed clinical decision support aligned with the "Five Rights" framework, supported by multidisciplinary governance and rigorous monitoring. Implementation teams should prioritize calibration and decision utility metrics over discrimination alone, establish model&#x2011;life&#x2011;cycle governance, and integrate clinician training to build trust.
