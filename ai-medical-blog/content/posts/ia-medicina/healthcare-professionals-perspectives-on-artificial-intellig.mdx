## Resumen

Artificial intelligence (AI) tools enhance health care by decision making, reducing errors, and delivering the best care to patients. Healthcare professionals are the users of the AI tools, and it is essential to have knowledge and skills in the utilization of AI tools to deliver effective care. Therefore, this study systematically explores the healthcare professional perspectives in using AI tools in clinical practice and identifies the facilitators and challenges associated with their usage. Three databases, PubMed, EBSCOhost, and ACM Digital Library, are systematically used to identify qualitative research studies. Appropriate selection of research articles is carried out by the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The Critical Appraisal Studies Programme tool is utilized for assessment. Data are extracted and analysed effectively. Out of 1292 articles,10 qualitative research studies which meet the objectives of the research are included. By analysing the information, six themes developed are behaviour, perceived usefulness, performance expectancy, ethical and legal aspects, challenges, and AI tool proficiency. Healthcare professionals acknowledge the value of AI tools in clinical practice; however, clinicians often lack the necessary competencies for their effective deployment. It is therefore imperative that healthcare practitioners collaborate with developers during the design phase of AI systems, ensuring due consideration of ethical and legal requirements. While AI technologies offer numerous advantages, prioritizing transparency and explainability is essential to optimize their integration within clinical workflows. Ongoing proficiency with AI tools may be sustained through structured training programmes and the establishment of clear operational guidelines.
