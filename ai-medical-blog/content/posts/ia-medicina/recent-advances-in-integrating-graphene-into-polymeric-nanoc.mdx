## Resumen

Hydrogels are widely used in biomedical applications because they are biocompatible, respond to external stimuli, and closely mimic the mechanical properties of natural tissues. However, conventional hydrogels often exhibit poor electrical conductivity, low mechanical strength, and limited functionality, hindering their use in advanced biomedical platforms. These challenges can be addressed by integrating 2D graphene and its derivatives into polymer-based nanocomposite hydrogels (CHGs). Graphene-enhanced CHGs offer superior mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, thermal stability, and optical properties, making them ideal for advanced biomedical applications. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of graphene's structural and functional properties and its incorporation into hydrogel matrices for CHG synthesis. It explores recent advancements in graphene-based CHGs for drug delivery, tissue engineering, and photothermal therapy (PTT), highlighting their enhanced performance. Additionally, it examines the emerging role of machine learning (ML) in optimizing CHG properties, such as predictive modeling for wearable sensors in biomedical contexts. By bridging materials science and computational intelligence, this review outlines a roadmap for designing next-generation smart hydrogels, emphasizing their transformative potential in addressing complex healthcare challenges.
