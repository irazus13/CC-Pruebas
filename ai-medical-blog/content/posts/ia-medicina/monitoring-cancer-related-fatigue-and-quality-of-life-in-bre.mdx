## Resumen

The REBECCA project taps into the potential of using real-world data (RWD) for supporting groundbreaking clinical research on complex chronic conditions as a complement to Randomised Controlled Trials. REBECCA moves beyond the analysis of clinical data from Electronic health records, by combining it with detailed monitoring data from multiple wearables, online behaviour and self-reported data to monitor patients's quality of life in terms of their functional and emotional status. The project focuses on the detection of cancer-related fatigue, developed during breast cancer recovery, using digital biomarker profiles for early detection of the disease and assessing the value of detailed and longitudinal patient monitoring as a means of improving patient care. The project also demonstrates the extensibility of REBECCA monitoring to other forms of cancer, such as prostate cancer. We describe the three clinical trials being conducted in Norway and the use of the REBECCA platform, capable of detailed monitoring and privacy preserving federated cross-country data analysis. The RWD will be analyzed in the context of data from questionnaires (Patient Reported Outcome Measures) and results from analysis of biological samples. Through this approach we expect that the REBECCA project will produce new knowledge on clinical management of cancer patients and contribute to new biological knowledge on cancer-related fatigue. Status and perspectives: The REBECCA project is ongoing, and patient follow-up will be completed during February 2026. The initial analyses of RWD, PROMs and biological samples have started together with the partners in the REBECCA consortium. The REBECCA trials are approved by the Regional Ethics Committee of the Western Health Authority (REK Vest) under the IDs 225,855 (REBECCA-1), 242,088 (REBECCA-2) and 619,903 (REBECCA-3). All trials have also been registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05587777, NCT06120595 and NCT06435091). Trial registration: NCT05587777, Retrospectively registered 19th of October 2022, https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/ NCT05587777; NCT05587777, Retrospectively registered 6th of November 2023, https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/ NCT06120595; NCT05587777, Retrospectively registered 23rd of May 2024, https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/ NCT06435091.
