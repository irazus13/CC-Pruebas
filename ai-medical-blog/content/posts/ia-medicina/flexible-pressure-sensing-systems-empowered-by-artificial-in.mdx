## Resumen

Flexible pressure sensing systems have shown great promise in applications such as personalized healthcare and human-machine interaction (HMI), due to their ability to conform to dynamic surfaces and sensitively transduce mechanical stimuli. Real-world environments often introduce challenges such as signal noise, baseline drift, and electromagnetic interference, which limit sensing accuracy. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms provides practical solutions for enhancing signal processing, feature extraction, and system adaptability. This review summarizes recent advances in high-performance pressure sensor design and AI algorithm development, with an emphasis on their synergistic integration. Three representative human-centric application scenarios are discussed, along with key challenges, emerging trends, and future prospects for intelligent pressure sensing systems. Continued interdisciplinary innovation is expected to drive the evolution of intelligent pressure sensors, enabling broader applications and enhanced user experiences.
