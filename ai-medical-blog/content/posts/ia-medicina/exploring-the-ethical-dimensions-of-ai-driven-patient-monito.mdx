## Resumen

**BACKGROUND:** Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly applied in intensive care units (ICUs) to enhance monitoring, prediction and decision-making. While these systems may improve patient safety and support nursing practice, their integration raises significant ethical concerns. **AIM:** To explore the ethical dimensions of AI-driven patient monitoring in critical care nursing, focusing on autonomy, privacy, accountability and equity as reported by ICU nurses and patients. **STUDY DESIGN:** A systematic search of PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus and ProQuest Central identified empirical studies published between 2010 and 2025 that addressed ethical implications of AI in ICU nursing. **RESULTS:** Six studies were included: three cross-sectional surveys, two qualitative interview studies and one pilot feasibility trial, involving 837 ICU nurses and 22 ICU patients. Four ethical themes were identified. Autonomy: Nurses feared automation bias and erosion of judgement, though trust in AI reduced decision regret. Privacy: Continuous data collection raised strong concerns, with governance and training seen as prerequisites for adoption. Accountability: Lack of algorithmic transparency limited nurses' willingness to act on outputs. Equity: Risks of biased datasets and subgroup disparities threatened fair care delivery. **CONCLUSIONS:** AI-driven monitoring can enhance nursing practice but introduces ethical vulnerabilities. Protecting autonomy, safeguarding privacy, ensuring transparency and addressing equity are essential for responsible integration in critical care nursing. **RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE:** Nurses require enhanced AI literacy and ethical training to integrate technology with patient-centred care. Robust governance must clarify accountability and ensure transparency, while research should focus on long-term impacts and develop nursing-specific ethical frameworks.
