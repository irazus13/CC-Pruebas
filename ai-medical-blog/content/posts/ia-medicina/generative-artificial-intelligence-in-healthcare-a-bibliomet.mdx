## Resumen

With the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) technology, an increasing number of studies are integrating Gen AI into healthcare. This study analyzed 1987 English publications in this field using bibliometric methods, sourced from the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC). The findings reveal a significant increase in publications since 2023, with 496 publications in 2023 and 1478 publications in 2024. The most contributing and influential journal was the Journal of Medical Internet Research. The total number of publications (TP) of this journal was 66, and the total number of citations (TC) was 1108. The most contributing country/region, affiliation, and author were the United States of America (TP&#xa0;=&#xa0;841, TC&#xa0;=&#xa0;8740), Harvard University (TP&#xa0;=&#xa0;89, TC&#xa0;=&#xa0;815), and Lechien, Jerome R. (TP&#xa0;=&#xa0;18, TC&#xa0;=&#xa0;228), respectively. The closest partnerships were observed between the USA and China, Tel Aviv University and Chaim Sheba Medical Center, and Cheungpasitporn, Wisit, and Thongprayoon, Charat, respectively. Research topics of all publications mainly focused on the application of Gen AI in clinical diagnosis, decision support, medical education, patient education, and mental health management, while also emphasizing technical and ethical challenges. Notably, several clusters highlighted the relevance of Gen AI in surgery, underscoring its potential impact in this key branch of healthcare. The findings will provide academic insights for technology developers and policymakers, as well as guidance for future research directions.
