## Resumen

**INTRODUCTION:** Despite traditional workups, accurate diagnosis of patients who are classified under cryptogenic stroke with underrecognized etiologies is very challenging. Accurate diagnosis is important for timely and optimized treatment modalities, disease progression monitoring, and proper treatment assessment. **AREAS COVERED:** This review highlights the limitations regarding the diagnosis of ischemic stroke with underrecognized etiologies and discusses the novel technologies that can shape the future diagnosis with personalized medicine approach. The current article is based on English language research articles selected from PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science search using the following search terms: embolic stroke of undetermined source, cryptogenic stroke, atrial cardiopathy, PFO closure, cancer-associated stroke, wearable devices, multiomics, stroke and artificial intelligence. **EXPERT OPINION:** Soon, extended diagnostic workups, multiomics, wearable and implantable technologies, and novel imaging techniques will become more common in routine diagnosis of ischemic stroke. The integration of novel technologies supported by artificial intelligence will transform stroke management with rapid and precise diagnosis and individualized treatment strategies. This will put future diagnosis in the hands of patients and the gradual integration of the novel technologies may provide real-time, patient-specific stroke management options.
