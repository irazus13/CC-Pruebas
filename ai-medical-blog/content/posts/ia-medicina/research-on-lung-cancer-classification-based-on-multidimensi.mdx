## Resumen

Accurate subtyping of lung cancer is crucial for developing personalized treatment plans and improving patient outcomes. This study established machine learning models for lung cancer subtyping by integrating multidimensional hematological indicators, offering advantages such as non-invasiveness, repeatability, and the capability for dynamic disease monitoring. The study utilized data from 771 lung cancer patients for model construction and validation, and an additional 510 independent cases were collected to assess the clinical applicability of the models. Ten supervised learning algorithms were screened, ultimately identifying the XGBoost model as optimal for differentiating small cell lung cancer from non-small cell lung cancer, and the Random Forest model as optimal for distinguishing lung squamous cell carcinoma from lung adenocarcinoma. In the independent clinical validation cohorts from two centers, these two models achieved accuracies of 95% and 91%, respectively, demonstrating good clinical applicability and serving as a valuable complement to pathological biopsy.
