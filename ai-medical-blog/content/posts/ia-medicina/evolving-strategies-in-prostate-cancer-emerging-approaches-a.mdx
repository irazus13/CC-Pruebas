## Resumen

**BACKGROUND:** The expansion of treatment options for prostate cancer (PC) has improved disease-specific and overall survival outcomes but has also raised questions about the optimal level of treatment needed for patients based on their individual prognosis and accounting for potential toxicity, incorporating quality of life considerations. **METHODS:** A panel of experts met to discuss current controversies in the care of patients with PC across the disease continuum. Multidisciplinary experts review advances and persistent uncertainties in biomarker-guided assessment, imaging, and systemic therapy for prostate cancer. The discussion outlines priority gaps in evidence that must be addressed to optimize individualized patient care. **RESULTS:** Workshop topics included use of genomic biomarkers and artificial intelligence-guided tools to identify and manage high-risk and very-high risk localized disease, management of biochemical recurrence, identification of patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive PC who warrant treatment escalation, radiopharmaceutical therapy for metastatic castration-resistant PC including optimal sequencing of approved therapies, role of imaging in identification and management of extraprostatic disease, and lifestyle interventions to optimize survivorship. **CONCLUSIONS:** Many questions remain about management of PC related to biomarker-based risk stratification to guide treatment selection, use of prostate-specific membrane antigen-positron emission tomography, and balancing the risk for PC-related death with risks for treatment-related toxicity. Ongoing research efforts are needed to optimize risk-based treatment, sequence of therapies throughout the disease continuum, and survivorship care.
