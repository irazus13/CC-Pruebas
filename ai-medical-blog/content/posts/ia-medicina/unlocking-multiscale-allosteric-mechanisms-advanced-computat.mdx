## Resumen

Multiscale allosteric mechanisms refer to regulatory processes in proteins that involve coordinated conformational changes and signal transmission occurring across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Exploiting these mechanisms provides promising opportunities in drug discovery due to potential advantages such as increased selectivity and fewer side effects compared to traditional orthosteric targeting. Nevertheless, systematically identifying allosteric sites and accurately deciphering their regulatory pathways remain challenging because these sites are often cryptic and regulated through intricate dynamic networks. Recent advances in computational methods, including multiscale molecular dynamics simulations, enhanced sampling techniques, topological network models, and machine learning-based analyses, have significantly improved our understanding of these multiscale allosteric phenomena. Here, we comprehensively summarize state-of-the-art computational strategies applied to the study of multiscale allosteric mechanisms and highlight their direct implications for drug discovery. Through representative examples, we demonstrate how computational approaches facilitate the identification of hidden allosteric sites, unravel complex regulatory pathways, and address issues related to drug resistance driven by mutations. Finally, we discuss the necessity of integrating these computational insights with experimental validation, underscoring a synergistic approach to accelerate the rational design and optimization of novel allosteric therapeutics.
