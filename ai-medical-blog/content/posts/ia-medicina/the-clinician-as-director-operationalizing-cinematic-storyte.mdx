## Resumen

Clinical documentation is undergoing a structural transformation. Ambient artificial intelligence (AI) systems and large language models are increasingly capable of generating complete clinical notes from conversation transcripts, structured data, and templates, often with minimal clinician input. While these systems reduce clerical burden and improve efficiency, they introduce a new and underrecognized risk: erosion of narrative control. AI-generated notes frequently resemble unedited footage rather than finished stories, dense with information yet lacking framing, causality, prioritization, and closure. Film and television faced an analogous challenge decades ago, integrating fragmented scenes, multiple contributors, and extensive post-production editing into coherent narratives through formal storytelling mechanics. This article bridges cinematic storytelling principles and clinical documentation, reframing clinicians as directors rather than scribes in an AI-driven environment. We operationalize narrative constructs such as framing, stakes, conflict, continuity, resolution, and foreshadowing as practical tools for constructing and editing clinical notes. The DIRECTOR Framework defines the core narrative engine of documentation, while two Director-Level Overrides ensure ethical tone and authorship integrity. Multiple before-and-after examples of AI-generated notes demonstrate how minimal clinician intervention can restore reasoning, preserve human intent, and improve patient safety. In the era of ambient AI, storytelling is not a metaphor for documentation. It is the control layer that keeps the medical record intelligible, defensible, and humane.
