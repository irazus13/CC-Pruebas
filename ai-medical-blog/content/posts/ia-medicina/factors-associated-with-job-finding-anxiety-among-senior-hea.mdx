## Resumen

**BACKGROUND:** Today, university students are experiencing increasing anxiety about finding a job after graduation. One of the factors intensifying this concern is the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and their potential to replace human labor in certain professions. **METHODS:** This study examined the association between attitudes toward AI and job finding anxiety (JFA), as well as other factors related to JFA, among senior students in health-related disciplines. The study was conducted as an analytical cross-sectional design. Data were collected using the Descriptive Information Form, the General Attitude Towards Artificial Intelligence Scale, and the Job Finding Anxiety Scale. The study population consisted of 478 students, and the sample included 326 senior students in the Faculty of Health Sciences at a university between November and December 2024. **RESULTS:** The analysis revealed that internet technology usage status, department, and knowledge about the use of AI in healthcare were significantly associated with students' JFA. The multiple regression model explained 16.9% of the variance in JFA (adjusted R&#xb2; = 0.169). A weak positive correlation was found between students' internet technology use and their JFA scores (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.168, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). No significant relationship was identified between students' attitudes toward AI and their JFA. **CONCLUSIONS:** The findings indicate that students' JFA is shaped more by their academic context, use of internet technologies, and knowledge of the application of AI in healthcare than by their general attitudes toward AI. Accordingly, strategies to reduce JFA among health sciences students should prioritize the development of AI-related professional competence rather than attempting to modify general attitudes toward AI. **CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER:** not applicable.
