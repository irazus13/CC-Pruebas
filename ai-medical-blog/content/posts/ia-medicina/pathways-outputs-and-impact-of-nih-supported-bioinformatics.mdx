## Resumen

Global biomedical and health research is increasingly relying on genomic and computational approaches, largely driven by the increasing volumes of nucleic acid sequencing. Concurrently, epidemiological studies and clinical records are generating enormous amounts of data amenable to disease modeling, machine learning, and artificial intelligence techniques. Bioinformatics and data science expertise is therefore essential for improved population health. Accordingly, in 2012, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) in partnership with the Wellcome Trust, and with support from the African Society for Human Genetics, initiated the H3Africa (Human Heredity and Health in Africa) consortium. One of its key goals was to build capacity among African scientists to lead research on genetic and environmental contributors to health and disease across the continent. In 2017, the NIH provided funding to support the establishment of four graduate bioinformatics training programs across five African universities. Over seven years, these programs enrolled multiple trainees (n&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;270), with &gt;110 earning Master's degrees and &gt;20 completing PhDs in Bioinformatics. It is thus timely to evaluate the outcomes and impact of these programs, particularly regarding graduation rates, career trajectories, and the institutions and research domains their alumni are serving. We also assess employment outcomes and the nature of the research they are enabling (n&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;110 peer-reviewed articles). We additionally include the progress and outputs of the programs' instructors, which were partially enabled by program resources, networks, and trainees. Overall, this review paints valuable insights into the pioneering role of NIH extramural support in shaping Africa's biomedical research landscape.
