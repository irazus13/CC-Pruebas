## Resumen

**INTRODUCTION:** In recent years, the evolving discourse surrounding Advanced Practice (AP) in radiography has highlighted potential need for a more harmonized educational approach across Europe. However, variations in healthcare systems, policies and curricula create challenges. This study aimed to explore the unique perspectives of European radiography educators on aspects of AP education at undergraduate and postgraduate level. **METHODS:** Using a qualitative design, three focus groups were conducted with European radiography educators, as part of EFRS Research Hub at ECR 2023. The discussions were audio-recorded, transcribed, and subsequently categorised and analysed using Braun and Clarke thematic analysis method to identify patterns and gain insights into AP education in radiography across Europe. **RESULTS:** Twenty-two radiography educators from nine different European countries participated in the focus groups. Analysis resulted in three main themes: definitions of AP, post graduate education in AP and undergraduate education in AP. Key findings include a growing consensus for a master's-level education as a requirement for AP, though clinical experience and mentorship were deemed essential. Participants advocated for integrating AP culture and concepts at undergraduate level, promoting critical thinking, research engagement, and potential future development in areas like patient assessment and artificial intelligence. **CONCLUSION:** This study highlights differences in interpretation and implementation of AP among European radiography educators. A shared sentiment emerged that the promotion of AP culture should start at undergraduate level, however different national regulations and curricula will likely make a single European approach problematic. Thus, the need for clear frameworks and well-defined career paths is evident. **IMPLICATION FOR PRACTICE:** Standardized AP frameworks, supportive work cultures, and integrated undergraduate AP education are essential to support the development of AP in radiography across Europe, fostering clear career pathways.
