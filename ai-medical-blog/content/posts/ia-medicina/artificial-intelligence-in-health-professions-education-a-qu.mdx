## Resumen

**BACKGROUND:** Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into education and healthcare, raising questions about how students use these technologies and how AI influences their learning. In health education, understanding these trends is particularly important because student learning directly impacts future clinical skills. **OBJECTIVE:** This study aimed to explore the use of AI tools by health sciences students at the University of Ottawa. More specifically, it sought to identify the most frequently used AI tools, describe students' usage habits, determine which tools support knowledge acquisition and skill development, and gather students' recommendations for effective strategies to raise awareness and train their peers on the responsible use of AI. **METHODS:** A qualitative approach was employed with students from ten health professions who reported using AI in their studies. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and an open-ended qualitative online survey. Inductive thematic analysis within an interpretive paradigm was applied to capture patterns, perceptions, and emergent themes. **RESULTS:** 51 health professions students participated in the study. Most were women between the ages of 20 and 29. ChatGPT emerged as the most frequently used AI tool. Students perceived AI as a complementary tool that facilitated knowledge acquisition, skill development, writing and problem-solving. AI adoption was driven by curiosity, peer influence, and the desire to improve work efficiency. Students critically evaluated AI results, integrated the tools into their learning processes, and emphasized the importance of technical skills, critical thinking and digital literacy. Peer learning, hands-on demonstrations, and access to online resources were recommended for effective AI training. **CONCLUSIONS:** This research demonstrates that health professions students actively use AI tools, particularly ChatGPT, to support learning, skill development and academic tasks. Although AI is valuable as an educational aid and its use varies by student and context, this highlights the need for structured guidance, critical evaluation skills and peer-supported training. These findings highlight the importance of thoughtfully integrating AI into educational programs to enhance learning outcomes, foster skill acquisition, ensure responsible and effective adoption.
