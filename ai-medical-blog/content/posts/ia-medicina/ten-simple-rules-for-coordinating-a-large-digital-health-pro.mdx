## Resumen

Coordinating a large-scale digital health project requires a unique mix of scientific leadership, administrative skill, and human sensitivity. Drawing from our experience leading CAPABLE, a European Horizon 2020 project aimed at improving the quality of life of cancer patients through AI and telemedicine, we present ten practical rules for navigating the complex landscape of multi-partner biomedical research. These rules address challenges such as building balanced consortia, managing timelines and regulatory requirements, ensuring cultural alignment, and promoting long-term impact through dissemination and exploitation. The paper specifically addresses international research projects at the intersection of healthcare and IT and their peculiar challenges, typically connected to the interplay of different actors such as academics, healthcare personnel, and industry partners located in different countries, each from diverse backgrounds and different working practices. Our goal is to provide researchers and project coordinators with concrete guidance to increase the likelihood of success in future large digital health initiatives.
