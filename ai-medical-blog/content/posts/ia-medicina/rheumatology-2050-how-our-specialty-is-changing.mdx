## Resumen

Rheumatology has undergone unprecedented transformation over the past quarter century, evolving from broad-spectrum immunosuppression to precision therapeutics targeting specific immune pathways. As the clinical, biological and economic landscape continues to evolve, understanding emerging trends is crucial for shaping the future of the specialty. In this narrative review, we will examine contemporary themes that will define rheumatology by 2050, spanning key areas of rheumatological practice, including precision medicine, genomic discoveries, disease prevention, cellular therapies and healthcare economics. Multiple transformative trends are currently reshaping rheumatology. Precision medicine is advancing beyond single-pathway targeting towards molecular stratification integrating serology, genomics and synovial pathotyping. Whole-exome sequencing has revealed new disease entities such as vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory, somatic (VEXAS) syndrome, while disease interception strategies show promise for preventing established autoimmunity, with trials demonstrating potential relative risk reduction in rheumatoid arthritis development using abatacept in at-risk individuals. Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy has achieved complete clinical remission in severe systemic lupus erythematosus, while immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced rheumatic diseases present new diagnostic challenges. Environmental pressures, including air pollution and occupational exposures, are increasingly recognised as disease drivers. In the UK, national audit data show disparities in access to advanced therapies even within a universal healthcare system. Artificial intelligence integration promises enhanced diagnostics and monitoring, while economic pressures necessitate innovative funding models, with biosimilars demonstrating potential for expanding treatment access. By 2050, rheumatology will be characterised by molecularly stratified diseases, more affordable and accessible targeted therapies, curative cellular interventions and digital clinical ecosystems. Success will depend not only on technological advances but on ensuring equitable access, affordability, and preservation of patient-centred care.
