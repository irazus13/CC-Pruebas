## Resumen

Breast cancer is not just a disease; it is a global crisis that continues to claim lives, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where late-stage diagnosis is the norm rather than the exception. Unlike high-income countries (HICs), where early detection has significantly improved survival rates, women in LMICs face an uphill battle against fragmented healthcare systems, limited diagnostic tools, cultural barriers, and financial constraints. The very technologies that revolutionized screening in HICs remain out of reach for many, leaving millions vulnerable to preventable deaths. This article calls for bold leadership and coordinated global efforts to ensure that every woman, regardless of geography or socioeconomic status, has access to life-saving early detection and treatment, in addition to highlighting the urgent need for equitable breast cancer screening in LMICs and exploring innovative approaches that have the potential to transform early detection and improve outcomes. Decentralized diagnostic hubs, AI-powered imaging, mobile screening units, and public-private partnerships are emerging as viable solutions to bridge the gap. Moreover, creative financing models and culturally tailored awareness campaigns offer hope for overcoming financial and social barriers. We can drive a paradigm shift toward equity in cancer care by reimagining breast cancer screening through technology and community engagement.
