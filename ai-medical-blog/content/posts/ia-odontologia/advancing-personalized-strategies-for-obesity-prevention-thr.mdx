## Resumen

The BETTER4U project (Preventing Obesity through Biologically and bEhaviorally Tailored inTERventions for You) is a Horizon Europe initiative (GAP 101080117) dedicated to advancing our understanding of the multifaceted etiology of obesity. The project aims to move beyond current knowledge of obesity-related determinants by examining the system-level interactions between biological (including genetics), lifestyle behaviors (physical activity, nutrition, sedentary behaviors), and contextual factors, including social, economic, psychological, and environmental factors. BETTER4U advances from traditional approaches by exploring determinants embedded within interconnected systems and biological frameworks. It seeks to identify and integrate polygenic risks, omics-based markers, lifestyle and contextual factors using data from biobanks and previous landmark studies. This comprehensive approach enables the refinement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms, enhancing individualization in the design of tailored interventions. The project employs real-time behavioral monitoring tools and remote technologies to track individual behaviors and metabolic responses, allowing for the development of personalized obesity prevention strategies. By doing so, BETTER4U aims to bridge the gap between research and practical application, enabling the design of interventions that are biologically and behaviorally informed. The anticipated outcomes of BETTER4U include advanced AI models that support the development of sophisticated, targeted interventions for individuals at risk of overweight or obesity. These models will provide actionable insights into how personalized lifestyle adjustments in lifestyle behaviors, such as diet and physical activity, can effectively mitigate weight gain trajectories across the lifespan. Ultimately, the project seeks to empower individuals and support precision medicine approaches in obesity prevention and treatment through active participant engagement.
