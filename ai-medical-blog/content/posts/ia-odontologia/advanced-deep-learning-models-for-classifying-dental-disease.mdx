## Resumen

Background/Objectives: Dental diseases represent a great problem for oral health care, and early diagnosis is essential to reduce the risk of complications. Panoramic radiographs provide a detailed perspective of dental structures that is suitable for automated diagnostic methods. This paper aims to investigate the use of an advanced deep learning (DL) model for the multiclass classification of diseases at the sub-diagnosis level using panoramic radiographs to resolve the inconsistencies and skewed classes in the dataset. Methods: To classify and test the models, rich data of 10,580 high-quality panoramic radiographs, initially annotated in 93 classes and subsequently improved to 35 consolidated classes, was used. We applied extensive preprocessing techniques like class consolidation, mislabeled entry correction, redundancy removal and augmentation to reduce the ratio of class imbalance from 2560:1 to 61:1. Five modern convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures-InceptionV3, EfficientNetV2, DenseNet121, ResNet50, and VGG16-were assessed with respect to five metrics: accuracy, mean average precision (mAP), precision, recall, and F1-score. Results: InceptionV3 achieved the best performance with a 97.51% accuracy rate and a mAP of 96.61%, thus confirming its superior ability for diagnosing a wide range of dental conditions. The EfficientNetV2 and DenseNet121 models achieved accuracies of 97.04% and 96.70%, respectively, indicating strong classification performance. ResNet50 and VGG16 also yielded competitive accuracy values comparable to these models. Conclusions: Overall, the results show that deep learning models are successful in dental disease classification, especially the model with the highest accuracy, InceptionV3. New insights and clinical applications will be realized from a further study into dataset expansion, ensemble learning strategies, and the application of explainable artificial intelligence techniques. The findings provide a starting point for implementing automated diagnostic systems for dental diagnosis with greater efficiency, accuracy, and clinical utility in the deployment of oral healthcare.
