## Resumen

**OBJECTIVE:** This review evaluates the specific applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in prosthodontic and implant dentistry education, and discusses related educational challenges. **DATA AND SOURCES:** Searches in PubMed, Scopus, Wiley and Web of Science used targeted keywords including artificial intelligence, prosthodontics, education, implant dentistry, virtual simulation, and combinations of the keywords. **STUDY SELECTION:** We included 213 articles focusing exclusively on AI applications in prosthodontic and implant dentistry education, covering theoretical learning, skill training, and clinical practice. **RESULTS:** The review identified key AI applications: 1) Generative AI enhancing theoretical learning on Prosthodontics and Implant Dentistry for students and faculty; 2) AI-powered simulators and assessment tools improving laboratory and clinical skill training of Prosthodontics and Implant Dentistry. 3) Critical challenges regarding academic integrity, algorithmic bias, and data privacy were also highlighted. **CONCLUSIONS:** AI offers transformative potential in medical education and translation by enhancing skill acquisition and assessment. Addressing the ethical and practical challenges is essential for its successful and responsible integration into the curriculum.
