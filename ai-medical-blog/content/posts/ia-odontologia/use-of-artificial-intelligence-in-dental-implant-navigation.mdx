## Resumen

Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming dental implant navigation systems, making implant surgeries more precise, efficient, and predictable. This scoping review examines how AI improves implantology, covering planning, surgery, and follow-up care, based on studies from 2019 to 2025. AI uses advanced computer programs to analyze 3D scans, automatically planning implant positions with high accuracy. During surgery, AI guides tools in real time, adjusting for jaw movements to place implants within a fraction of a millimeter of the plan. These systems reduce mistakes, shorten surgery time by up to 30%, and improve how implants bond with bone. AI also predicts long-term implant success by analyzing patient data, helping dentists plan better follow-up care. Despite these benefits, challenges remain. AI systems can be hard to understand, raising concerns about trust and reliability. They may work less well for some patient groups if trained on limited data, and strict regulations can slow their use in clinics. High costs also limit access, especially for smaller practices. Ethical issues, like protecting patient data and ensuring fair access to AI tools, are important to address. The review shows AI systems achieve very small errors, less than 2 degrees in angle and 0.5 mm in position, compared to traditional methods. Looking ahead, combining AI with technologies like augmented reality could make surgeries even more accurate, while predicting implant durability could improve outcomes. This scoping review highlights how AI can make implantology more personalized and tailored to each patient. Dentists are encouraged to use AI carefully, combining it with their expertise to provide better care. This work offers a clear guide for implantologists navigating the growing role of AI in dental implant surgery.
