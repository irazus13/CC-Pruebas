## Resumen

A composite of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and beta-tricalcium phosphate (&#x3b2;-TCP) was synthesized as a biomaterial filament for 3D printers and its analytical and chemical evaluation was performed. PVA powder and &#x3b2;-TCP were mixed in the range of 0-20&#x2005;wt% and hot-melt extruded at 200 &#xb0;C using a single-screw extruder. Comprehensive material characterization of the synthesized filament was performed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). XRD analysis confirmed that the amorphous nature of PVA and the crystalline nature of &#x3b2;-TCP coexisted and the physical mixture state was well maintained. In near-infrared spectroscopy, concentration-dependent spectral changes were observed by normalization, and principal component analysis showed that the first principal component explained 85.6% of the variance. In machine learning regression analysis, partial least squares regression (PLS), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) were compared, and SVM achieved the best prediction accuracy (R2&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.910). SEM observations confirmed streaky structures along the extrusion direction and uniform dispersion of &#x3b2;-TCP particles. This study demonstrated that a combined NIR spectroscopy and machine learning approach is effective as a non-destructive quality evaluation technique for composite filaments for 3D printing. This technique enables real-time composition monitoring and quality control of biomaterial filaments, and is expected to be applied to the manufacturing of patient-specific biomedical devices.
