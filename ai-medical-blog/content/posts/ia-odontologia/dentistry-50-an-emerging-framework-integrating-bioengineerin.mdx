## Resumen

Dentistry is undergoing a profound transformation driven by advances in bioengineering that integrate artificial intelligence (AI), regenerative biology, digital manufacturing, salivary diagnostics, and extended reality (XR). Despite the rapid pace of innovation, global disparities in infrastructure, research capacity, and workforce distribution continue to limit the equitable adoption of these technologies. The emerging paradigm of Reverse Evidence-Based Dentistry (rEBD) provides a framework to link real-world clinical practice with scientific validation, strengthening translational pathways across diverse health systems. This narrative review analyzes the global intersection between dentistry and bioengineering, examining how innovations in AI-assisted diagnostics, biomaterials, regenerative platforms, wearable technologies, and XR-based education influence oral-systemic health, translational research, and the development of Dentistry 5.0. A secondary objective is to propose policy, educational, and research strategies that support equitable implementation across high-income countries (HICs) and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), in alignment with rEBD principles. The review draws on international oral health data, biomedical engineering literature, global innovation studies, and academic collaborations, integrating evidence on regenerative dentistry, digital ecosystems, AI-driven diagnostics, frugal innovation for low-resource settings, and open-access scientific infrastructures. The findings indicate that bioengineering is reshaping dental practice through intelligent diagnostic systems, bioactive and regenerative materials, soft robotic devices, and digital manufacturing workflows, while AI- and XR-enhanced education platforms improve access to high-quality training, particularly in regions with limited infrastructure. Regional clinical hubs in LMICs facilitate context-specific validation of emerging technologies and support frugal innovation pathways, although persistent inequities remain in digital infrastructure, AI dataset diversity, regulatory readiness, and the integration of oral health into broader non-communicable disease strategies. Overall, Dentistry 5.0 reflects the convergence of biological, digital, and intelligent systems to deliver personalized, preventive, and globally connected oral healthcare, and its equitable implementation will require coordinated strategies grounded in the rEBD framework to ensure scientific rigor and global relevance.
