## Resumen

Background: Early detection of dental caries is essential for effective oral health management. Current diagnostic workflows rely heavily on radiographic imaging, which involves infrastructure requirements, workflow coordination, and resource considerations that may limit frequent use in high-throughput or resource-constrained settings. These contextual factors motivate exploration of adjunct screening concepts that could support front-end triage decisions within existing care pathways. This study evaluates, in simulation, whether modeled tooth-percussion response signals contain sufficient discriminative information to justify further translational and managerial investigation. Implementation costs, workflow optimization, and economic outcomes are not evaluated directly; rather, the objective is to assess whether the technical preconditions for a potentially scalable screening concept are satisfied under controlled in silico conditions. Methods: An in silico model of tooth percussion was developed in which enamel, dentin, and pulp/root structures were represented as a simplified layered mechanical system. Impulse responses generated from simulated tapping were used to compute the modeled surface-vibration response (enamel-layer displacement), which served as a proxy for a measurable percussion-related signal (e.g., contact vibration), rather than a recorded acoustic waveform. Carious conditions were simulated through depth-dependent reductions in stiffness and effective mass and increases in damping to represent enamel and dentin demineralization. A synthetic dataset of labeled simulated signals was generated under varying structural parameters and measurement-noise assumptions. Machine-learning models using Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) features were trained to classify healthy teeth, enamel caries, and dentin caries at a screening (triage) level. Results: Under baseline simulation conditions, the classifier achieved an overall accuracy of 0.97 with balanced macro-averaged F1-score (0.97). Misclassifications occurred primarily between healthy and enamel-caries categories, whereas dentin-caries cases were most consistently identified. When measurement noise and structural variability were increased, performance declined gradually, reaching approximately 0.90 accuracy under the most challenging simulated scenario. These results indicate that discriminative information is present within the modeled signals at a screening (triage) level, meaning that higher-risk categories can be distinguished probabilistically rather than with definitive diagnostic certainty. Sensitivity and specificity trade-offs were not optimized in this study, as the objective was to assess separability rather than to define clinical decision thresholds. Conclusions: Within the constraints of the in silico model, simulated tooth-percussion response signals demonstrated discriminative patterns between healthy, enamel caries, and dentin caries categories at a screening (triage) level. These findings establish technical plausibility under controlled simulation conditions and support further investigation of percussion-based screening as a potential adjunct to clinical assessment. From a healthcare management perspective, the present results address a prerequisite question-whether such signals contain sufficient information to justify translational research, rather than demonstrating workflow optimization, cost reduction, or system-level impact. Clinical validation, threshold optimization, and implementation studies are required before managerial or operational benefits can be evaluated.
