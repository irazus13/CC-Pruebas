## Resumen

**BACKGROUND:** Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool in dentistry, particularly in the early detection of oral cancer (OC) and oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs). Data focused on European dental students and their knowledge/attitudes towards the use of AI for diagnosing OC/OPMDs are limited. **METHODS:** A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among final-year dental students from six European countries. The questionnaire assessed knowledge, attitudes, and perceived barriers regarding AI in the diagnosis of OC and OPMDs. Data were analysed using descriptive and comparative statistics to evaluate differences between countries. **RESULTS:** A total of 328 students participated (75% female, 25% male). Most students stated that they had not received formal training in AI (61%) and emphasised the need to incorporate such training into the dental curriculum (47%). Students from Portugal had highest overall knowledge scores, but at the same time, lowest overall attitude scores. The most commonly perceived barrier was insufficient training (87.8%). **CONCLUSION:** Final-year dental students demonstrate positive attitudes towards AI aiding in diagnosis of OC and OPMDs, although significant knowledge and skill gaps remain. Integrating structured AI education into dental curricula is essential to prepare future academics and clinicians for responsible and effective AI use.
