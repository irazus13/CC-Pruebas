## Resumen

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing sector of technology in a variety of industries, especially healthcare. This literature review will explore the potential of AI systems to revolutionize the field of dentistry as well as their current limitations. Applications in development optimize the efficiency and accuracy of diagnosis and treatment planning in all areas of dentistry, showing success in detecting conditions such as dental caries, periodontal disease, and periapical lesions. In addition, AI has proven useful in analyzing features on dental images for purposes such as orthodontic treatment planning, implant placement, and third molar extraction. While these applications hold significant promise in shaping the future of dentistry, several limitations and challenges must be addressed before AI is adopted for widespread use. Among the concerns are ethical considerations regarding data security and patient consent as well as the potential for biases and error arising from limited training datasets. Once these issues are resolved, AI will represent a powerful tool for transforming the future of dentistry.
