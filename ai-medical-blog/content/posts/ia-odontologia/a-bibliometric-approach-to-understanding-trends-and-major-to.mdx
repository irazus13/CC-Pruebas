## Resumen

**OBJECTIVES:** This bibliometric analysis aimed to map the existing knowledge landscape and identify emerging research trends in the field of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). **STUDY DESIGN:** A search was performed in the Web of Science (Wos) Database from 1991 to 2024 using predefined criteria, focusing primarily on documents-related to CBCT. Citation-based metrics were applied to assess total and annual publication counts, document types, languages, Wos categories, journals, and countries. **RESULTS:** The search strategy yielded 16,058 original articles, published in 1,034 journals, authored from 113 countries. The United States was the most prolific contributor, leading in all six publication indicators. Notably, 43% of the publications fell under the 'Dentistry, Oral surgery and Medicine' category. Most articles were single-country publications. The research primarily focused on two main areas: clinical applications of CBCT and the optimization and quantitative evaluation of CBCT imaging. Clinical applications were further divided into subcategories including oral surgery and, implantology, dentistry, endodontology, radiation therapy, CBCT-guided technologies, and innovations driven by artificial intelligence. **CONCLUSIONS:** This bibliometric analysis offers an in-depth look at the evolution of CBCT in radiology, and provides valuable insights for future studies and opportunities to improve clinical decision-making through the advanced capabilities of CBCT technology.
