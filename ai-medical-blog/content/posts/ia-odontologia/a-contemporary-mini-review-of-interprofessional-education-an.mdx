## Resumen

**BACKGROUND:** Dental emergencies are increasing in frequency. Numerous studies have reported minimal knowledge and/or skills by emergency department staff regarding dental emergencies. The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted a paradigm shift in emergency dental care management away from traditional management approaches. However, there have been no reviews of contemporary literature pertaining to either technology-assisted or interprofessional education and dental emergency management in the emergency department setting. This mini-review aimed to synthesise current evidence of interprofessional education, utilising technology-assisted modalities, for the management of dental emergencies in hospital emergency departments. **METHODS:** A comprehensive search was carried out across four electronic databases, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and Google Scholar from 2018 to 2025. **RESULTS:** A total of three papers were identified and included in the mini-review. Two of the three papers addressed the subject of dental emergencies in the emergency department as a primary finding. **DISCUSSION:** Included papers were of low-quality evidence and referenced simulation-based education, tele-dentistry, and artificial intelligence as contemporary approaches relating to dental emergency management. **CONCLUSIONS:** This mini-review revealed minimal advances in contemporary approaches relating to both the use of technology-assisted modalities and interprofessional education for the management of dental emergencies within the hospital emergency department setting. This review provides a timely literature update for both the medical and dental professions and identifies a large gap in research surrounding this topic.
