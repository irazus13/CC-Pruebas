## Resumen

**CONTEXT:** The increasing incidence of secondary caries and the failure of restorations have intensified research into dental restorative materials capable of actively interacting with the oral environment. In this context, antibacterial and bioregenerative nanomaterials have attracted growing scientific interest due to their potential to inhibit biofilm formation while simultaneously supporting mineral repair processes. **OBJECTIVE:** This narrative review analyzes recent developments in nanostructured materials for restorative dentistry and oral health applications, with particular emphasis on antibacterial agents, bioactive systems, and emerging dual-function approaches that integrate multiple biological functions into restorative materials. **SCOPE OF THE REVIEW:** The analyzed literature indicates that metallic nanoparticles, cationic monomers, and natural nanopolymers can reduce bacterial adhesion and metabolic activity under experimental conditions. In parallel, bioactive nanomaterials such as nanohydroxyapatite, bioactive glass, and calcium phosphate-based systems have demonstrated the ability to release remineralizing ions and to promote mineral deposition at the tooth-material interface. Dual-function hybrid materials aim to combine these antibacterial and bioregenerative effects within a single restorative system. Interpretative Perspective: Despite these advances, most available evidence derives from in vitro and preclinical studies, with significant heterogeneity across experimental models, evaluation methods, and outcome variables. This variability limits direct comparisons between studies and necessitates a cautious interpretation of claims regarding long-term antibacterial efficacy, functional tissue regeneration, and routine clinical applicability. **CONCLUSIONS:** Antibacterial and bioregenerative nanomaterials represent a relevant and continuously evolving research direction in restorative dentistry. Their successful clinical translation will depend on establishing standardized testing protocols, conducting comprehensive safety assessments, and generating clinically relevant evidence supporting long-term efficacy and biological compatibility. Their successful clinical translation will depend on establishing standardized testing protocols, conducting comprehensive safety assessments, and generating clinically relevant evidence supporting long-term efficacy and biological compatibility.
