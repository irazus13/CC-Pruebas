## Resumen

**OBJECTIVES:** Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being utilized across various fields of medicine, presenting significant potential for the future of healthcare. This review is to systematically outline the current applications of AI in the field of oral health management and to provide an in-depth analysis of the associated challenges and future opportunities. **METHODS:** The review was based on a systematic electronic literature search conducted across databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus) with the keywords including "artificial intelligence," "AI in dentistry," "tele-dentistry," "oral health education," and "oral health management." English-language studies relevant to the application of AI across various aspects of oral health management were included based on independent assessments by two reviewers. **RESULTS:** We concluded that in the realm of oral health management, AI technology has diverse applications, including oral health education and counseling, monitoring, screening, diagnosis, treatment, follow-up care of oral diseases, and the collection and management of oral health data. By enhancing public awareness of oral health and improving self-management capabilities, AI can increase diagnostic accuracy, facilitate personalized treatments, support tele-dentistry, optimize the allocation of dental resources, and provide early warnings for oral diseases. These advancements collectively contribute to the efficiency and quality of oral health management. While AI demonstrates considerable promise in this field, several challenges remain, including inconsistencies in oral health data, limited availability and accessibility of data, the reliability of AI-driven results, and issues of bias and fairness in AI algorithms. Addressing these challenges is essential to fully harness the transformative potential of AI in oral health management. **CONCLUSION:** Oral health management encompasses the comprehensive handling of oral health risk factors in individuals, populations, and communities through a series of measures and activities aimed at maintaining and promoting oral health. The ultimate goal is to achieve the greatest societal benefit in oral health at the lowest possible cost. By addressing challenges such as data consistency, availability, and reliability, as well as issues of bias and fairness in AI algorithms, AI may play a significant role in oral health management. **CLINICAL RELEVANCE:** This paper reviews the role of artificial intelligence in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of oral diseases, providing an important reference for the later application of artificial intelligence in oral health management.
