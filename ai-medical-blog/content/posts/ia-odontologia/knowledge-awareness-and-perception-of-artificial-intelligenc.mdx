## Resumen

**PURPOSE:** Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming modern dentistry, particularly in prosthodontics. However, evidence regarding AI integration among dental professionals in Jordan remains limited, while insights into educational and clinical gaps affecting AI adoption remain unknown. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the knowledge, awareness, and perception of AI-driven prosthodontics among general dental practitioners and specialists in Jordan. **MATERIAL AND METHODS:** A cross-sectional design was chosen for this study using a self-administered questionnaire to evaluate knowledge, awareness, and perceptions of AI technologies in fixed and removable prosthodontics among dental practitioners in Jordan. Study participants were recruited using a convenience sampling technique. The study consisted of an anonymized questionnaire containing multiple choice, Likert scale and open- ended questions. The survey assessed demographic data, knowledge of AI applications, awareness of specific tools, and perceptions toward benefits, limitations, and ethical considerations of AI in prosthodontics. The association between the categorical variables was assessed using the chi-squared test of independence. The Spearman rank correlation test was used to assess the correlation between variables. A p-value of 0.05 was set as the level of significance. **RESULTS:** A total of 385 dental professionals participated in the survey (192 specialists in prosthetic dentistry and 193 general dental practitioners). Specialists reported higher awareness and use of AI in prosthodontics, including patient education, treatment planning, 3D implant positioning and quality control (P&lt;0.001). Overall knowledge scores were moderate (78.72 &#xb1; 9.93), while general practitioners showed higher agreement for general diagnostic use (P&lt;0.001). **CONCLUSIONS:** In Jordan dental professionals have moderate knowledge of AI in prosthodontics, with younger clinicians and specialists showing higher awareness and comfort. The perception of AI is mostly positive. However, actual adoption in practice remains limited.
