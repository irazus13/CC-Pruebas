## Resumen

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has introduced transformative possibilities in orthodontics by enhancing diagnostic precision, treatment planning, and aesthetic outcomes. In face-driven orthodontics, treatment objectives extend beyond achieving proper occlusion to optimizing facial balance and harmony. With the growing patient demand for aesthetic improvements, AI technologies enable clinicians to integrate facial analysis and dynamic soft-tissue evaluation into personalized treatment approaches. Research in this scoping review analyzed current applications of AI in face-driven orthodontics, focusing on diagnosis, soft-tissue assessment, and individualized treatment planning. A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed and Scopus for studies published between 2021 and 2025. The review followed the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Of 54 initially identified studies, 24 met the inclusion criteria after title, abstract, and full-text screening. Extracted data were organized according to the main application areas of AI in face-driven orthodontics. Most studies focused on AI-assisted facial analysis, 3D reconstruction, and treatment simulation. Deep learning models demonstrated high performance in soft-tissue prediction, aesthetic evaluation, and diagnostic accuracy. However, heterogeneity in datasets, a lack of standardized validation protocols, limited external validation across included studies and limited clinical applicability were identified as key limitations. AI-based facial analysis supports a shift toward individualized, aesthetics-oriented orthodontic planning. Although current evidence highlights its potential for improving diagnostic precision and treatment outcomes, further validation through large-scale clinical studies is essential for broader implementation in everyday practice.
